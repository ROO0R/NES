**Game Controls**:
In Paperboy 2, the D-pad controls the paperboy's movement left and right on the street and up and down between the sidewalk and the street. The A button is used to throw newspapers to the left, and the B button throws newspapers to the right. Players need to aim their throws to land newspapers in subscribers' mailboxes or on their doorsteps while avoiding obstacles and hazards.

**Game Plot**: 
In Paperboy 2, players resume the role of the titular paperboy (or papergirl, a new addition in this sequel) tasked with delivering newspapers to subscribers in a suburban neighborhood. The goal is to deliver papers accurately while navigating through various obstacles and hazards, from cars and dogs to skateboarders and runaway lawnmowers. The game spans a week of in-game time, challenging players to maintain and grow their subscriber base by successfully making deliveries and avoiding damage to non-subscribers' property.

**What to Expect**: 
Players can expect a challenging mix of precise aiming and quick reflex navigation. As you pedal down the street, you'll need to time your newspaper throws to hit subscribers' mailboxes and doorsteps accurately, earning points for precision. At the same time, you must dodge obstacles that can end your delivery day prematurely. The game requires attention to detail, as hitting a non-subscriber's window or damaging property can result in losing subscribers. It's a fun and engaging experience that tests both your aim and your ability to react under pressure.

**TL;DR**:
Deliver newspapers while navigating suburban obstacles and hazards.
