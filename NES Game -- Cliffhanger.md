Your mission involves saving hostages, which requires careful navigation and defeating enemies. The essence of gameplay revolves around timing your moves correctly and strategically using your combat skills to progress.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Mountain Melt S'mores* 
Imagine a campfire treat but with a cliffhanger twist: *Mountain Melt S'mores* are stacked high like the perilous cliffs in the game. Between graham crackers, a thick layer of the richest chocolate mimics the dangerous lands, and a fluffy marshmallow layer represents the snow, toasted to golden perfection. This treat is as adventurous and satisfying as Gabe's journey across the mountains.
