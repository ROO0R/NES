**Game Plot**: In "WWF Steel Cage Challenge," players step into the world of professional wrestling as one of their favorite WWF superstars from the early 90s. The game doesn't have a specific plot beyond the pursuit of championship glory within the squared circle. Players can select iconic wrestlers, each aiming to climb the ranks through various matches, including the titular steel cage match, to become the WWF Champion. The game's essence captures the over-the-top personalities and intense rivalries characteristic of early-90s WWF.

**What to Expect**: As you dive into the game, you'll control your selected wrestler in a bid for wrestling supremacy. Use the D-Pad for movement around the ring, press A to execute basic attacks like punches and grapples, and use B for more powerful moves or to initiate a grapple. When grappling, a combination of D-Pad directions and button presses allows you to perform signature moves unique to each wrestler. The goal is to weaken your opponent enough to pin them for a three-count or force them to submit. In steel cage matches, you'll also aim to climb out of the cage before your opponent can stop you. The game combines strategic positioning and timing to outmaneuver and overpower your opponent.

**TL;DR**: Wrestle as a WWF superstar, using attacks and grapples to win matches by pinfall, submission, or escaping a steel cage.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Punch, grapple, and climb your way to wrestling victory.

**Inspired Food Item**: *The Slammin' Suplex Sundae*. Imagine a towering sundae with layers of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, representing the good and bad guys of wrestling. Sandwiched between these layers are chunks of brownies (the "body slams") and a generous drizzle of hot fudge ("sweat"), topped with whipped cream and a cherry ("the championship belt"). Perfect for cooling down after a heated match.
