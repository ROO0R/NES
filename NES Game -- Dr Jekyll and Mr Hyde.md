**Game Plot**:  
In "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", players navigate the dual life of Dr. Henry Jekyll, a man who, after drinking a special potion, transforms into the nefarious Mr. Edward Hyde. The game alternates between these two personas, each with its own challenges and objectives. As Dr. Jekyll, the goal is to walk to the church for his wedding, avoiding various townspeople and obstacles that can cause stress, leading to his transformation into Mr. Hyde. As Mr. Hyde, players must battle monsters and survive the night, with the ultimate aim of returning to Dr. Jekyll's form to continue his journey.

**Full Game Explanation**:  
The gameplay uniquely integrates the story of Dr. Jekyll's struggle with his alter ego, Mr. Hyde, into a side-scrolling format. The player starts as Dr. Jekyll, trying to safely navigate through the streets to his wedding. Encountering enemies or hazards increases Jekyll's stress meter, triggering his transformation into Mr. Hyde. The game world for Mr. Hyde is a nightmarish version of Jekyll's, with more aggressive enemies. If Hyde's progress surpasses Jekyll's in this mirrored world, the game ends, representing Hyde's complete takeover. The challenge lies in balancing both personas to reach the game's end.
