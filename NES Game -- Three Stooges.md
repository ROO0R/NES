**Game Plot**: In "The Three Stooges," players are thrown into the zany world of Larry, Curly, and Moe, who are on a mission to save an orphanage from foreclosure. The game doesn't have a traditional linear storyline but rather a collection of humorous scenarios inspired by the classic shorts of the Three Stooges. As players navigate through different mini-games, they gather money to help keep the orphanage running. Each mini-game is a nod to the slapstick comedy and antics that made the Three Stooges famous, offering players a blend of nostalgia and light-hearted fun.

**What to Expect**: Imagine yourself diving into a series of wacky challenges, each requiring quick reflexes and a sense of humor. You'll control the Stooges, switching between them in various mini-games. Use the D-Pad to move and select different activities on the game's board. The A button is your action key, used for everything from pie throwing to racing in a hospital gurney. Each mini-game has its unique control scheme, but they're all simple enough to pick up quickly. Expect to laugh, groan, and maybe even shout at the screen as you attempt to master these quirky challenges and save the day.

**TL;DR**: Navigate a board, play diverse mini-games, save an orphanage with slapstick humor.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Mini-games galore with classic comedy.

**Inspired Food Item**: *StoogeBerry Pie*: This is a wild berry pie with a twist - every slice has a different combination of berries, making each bite a surprise. Just like the unpredictable nature of the Three Stooges themselves, you never know what you're going to get with StoogeBerry Pie. It's messy, it's sweet, and it's a little bit chaotic, embodying the spirit of slapstick comedy in every slice.
