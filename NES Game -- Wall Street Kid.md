**Game Plot**: In Wall Street Kid, the player assumes the role of a stock trader who has inherited $500,000 from a distant relative with the condition to turn this amount into a substantial fortune to prove their worth. Beyond just playing the stock market, the player must balance personal life, including health, home, and relationships, while meeting various challenges such as buying a house, a yacht, and ultimately securing a family castle. The game combines financial management with life simulation aspects, offering a unique blend of strategy and planning.

**What to Expect**: Wall Street Kid is not your typical NES game. It combines elements of financial trading with life simulation. You will use the D-Pad to navigate through menus to buy and sell stocks, manage your portfolio, and make lifestyle choices. A button selects options, and B button goes back. The game challenges you to grow your wealth through wise investment strategies while also requiring you to manage your time and money for personal life events, such as exercising, dating, and home buying. It's a balancing act between achieving financial success and maintaining a healthy personal life, emphasizing strategic planning and management.

**TL;DR**: Simulate stock trading while managing personal life and investments.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Trade stocks, buy houses, live life.
