**Game Plot**: In "Street Fighter 2010," players are thrust into the shoes of Ken, a character familiar from the Street Fighter series, though here in a completely different context. Set in a futuristic version of the year 2010, Ken has become a scientist and is seeking revenge for the murder of his friend, Troy. This quest leads him through various alien planets and dimensions, facing off against an assortment of bizarre enemies and bosses. Unlike the traditional fighting game narrative of the original Street Fighter, this game takes a sci-fi twist, presenting a story of personal vengeance and interdimensional travel.

**What to Expect**: "Street Fighter 2010" shifts from the traditional Street Fighter fighting mechanics to a more platformer-oriented gameplay with fighting elements. Players will use the D-Pad to move Ken through various levels, each filled with enemies and obstacles. The A button allows Ken to jump, crucial for navigating platforms and dodging enemy attacks. The B button is used for attacking, which Ken does using ranged energy blasts and physical strikes. Each level requires the player to defeat a certain number of enemies to open a portal to the next stage, combining fast-paced action with strategic movement and positioning.

**TL;DR**: Navigate levels, jump and attack with energy blasts and strikes, defeat enemies to progress.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jump, shoot, and punch through futuristic levels!

**Inspired Food Item**: *Galactic Punch Parfait* - A layered dessert that's as vibrant and energetic as the game itself. Starting with a base of electric blue gelato, representing Ken's energy blasts, followed by layers of cosmic purple and alien green sorbets, symbolizing the various alien environments and enemies encountered. Topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of edible glitter, this dessert is an interdimensional treat.
