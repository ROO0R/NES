**Game Controls**:
Players use the D-pad to control the direction of pitches and to move fielders. The A button is used to pitch the ball, swing the bat, and throw the ball while fielding.

**Game Plot**: 
"Major League Baseball" for the NES doesn't have a traditional plot or storyline, as it focuses on simulating the experience of playing baseball in a major league setting. Players select from one of the available teams and compete in baseball games against the computer or a second player. The goal is to win matches by scoring more runs than the opposing team through hitting, pitching, and fielding, thereby simulating the competitive nature of professional baseball.
