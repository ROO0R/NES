The game alternates between controlling the mech and the pilot on foot, each with unique abilities to navigate through levels filled with enemies and obstacles. The story revolves around the pilot's mission to thwart a malevolent organization's plan to dominate the world, using the Metal Mech to infiltrate enemy bases, destroy key targets, and ultimately confront the evil mastermind behind the scheme.

**What to Expect**: 
"Metal Mech" is a game where you'll switch between piloting a mech and navigating on foot. When in the mech, use the D-pad to move and B to fire at enemies. The A button makes the mech hover if upgraded. Without the mech, you're more vulnerable but can enter small spaces the mech can't. Press Select to leave or enter your mech. The game requires strategic use of both forms to progress through levels, solve puzzles, and defeat bosses. Expect to manage this dual gameplay mechanic to overcome challenges.

**TL;DR**: Pilot a mech or go on foot to fight enemies and solve puzzles.
