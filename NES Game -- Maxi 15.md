**Game Controls**:
The controls in "Maxi 15" vary significantly between the 15 included games. Generally, the D-pad moves characters or navigates menus, the A button is used for main actions like jumping or shooting, and the B button often serves a secondary action or special ability. Start pauses the game or accesses the menu, and Select sometimes switches items or modes within games.

Many of the games lean towards action or adventure themes, with players often tasked with overcoming obstacles, defeating enemies, or completing levels. The variety means there's no overarching narrative, but rather a collection of individual experiences ranging from sports simulations to space shooters.

Imagine a snack mix as diverse as the "Maxi 15" game compilation itself.
