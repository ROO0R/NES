**Game Controls**:
In Pac-Man, the D-pad controls the movement of Pac-Man through the maze. There are no buttons for attack; instead, players navigate Pac-Man to eat pellets and avoid or chase ghosts depending on the situation. The objective is to clear the maze of pellets while avoiding being caught by ghosts.

**Game Plot**: 
Pac-Man does not have a traditional narrative or storyline. The game is set in a maze where the player controls Pac-Man, a yellow, circular creature whose main goal is to eat all the dots placed throughout the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) that roam the maze. Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" allows Pac-Man to temporarily eat the ghosts for extra points, adding a strategic element to the game.

**What to Expect**: 
Expect a straightforward yet challenging gameplay experience focused on quick reflexes and strategic thinking. Players must navigate the maze efficiently, deciding when to grab the Power Pellets and go on the offensive against the ghosts or avoid them altogether. The game gets progressively harder as you clear levels, with ghosts speeding up. It's a classic arcade game that's easy to understand but difficult to master, offering endless entertainment as you aim to beat your high score.

**TL;DR**:
Eat dots, avoid ghosts, clear levels for high scores.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: 
Classic maze chase arcade game.
