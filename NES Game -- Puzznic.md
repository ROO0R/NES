**Game Controls**:
In Puzznic, players use the D-pad to move the cursor on the screen to select and slide puzzle blocks horizontally. The A button is used to confirm the selection of a block, and the B button may be used to cancel a move. The objective is to manipulate blocks to match them with identical ones, which will then disappear, clearing the level when all blocks are matched and removed.
