**Game Plot**:
"RoboCop 2" follows the story of the titular character, a cyborg police officer in a crime-ridden Detroit. The game is loosely based on the film of the same name, where RoboCop must stop a new drug called "Nuke" from spreading across the city. He faces numerous enemies, including street gangs and the corrupt corporation OCP, which plans to replace him with their new creation, RoboCop 2. The plot unfolds as RoboCop battles through various levels to find the source of Nuke and confronts the new cyborg threat.
