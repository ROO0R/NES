**Game Plot**: 
"Lemmings" doesn't follow a traditional storyline but rather presents a series of increasingly difficult challenges. Players must guide a stream of lemmings through various obstacles to the level's exit. The lemmings will walk mindlessly forward, and it's up to the player to assign them roles such as diggers, builders, blockers, and bombers to navigate through obstacles and avoid deadly traps. The goal is to save as many lemmings as possible, with each level requiring a minimum number saved to progress.

**What to Expect**: 
Expect a mix of fast-paced puzzle solving and strategic planning. You‚Äôll need to quickly decide which roles to assign to your lemmings to safely guide them to the exit. Each level introduces new obstacles, requiring creative solutions and precise timing. The game starts off simple but becomes increasingly complex, offering a serious challenge in the later levels. Managing your limited resources (the number of times each task can be assigned) is crucial for success.

**TL;DR**:
Guide mindless lemmings to safety through puzzles and obstacles.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: 
Puzzle solving with cute but clueless creatures.

**Inspired Food Item**: *The Lemming Leap Parfait*
A layered dessert with alternating stripes of lemon curd and blueberry compote, topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed biscuits to represent the earthy obstacles lemmings encounter. This sweet treat is as delightful and challenging as navigating the lemmings to safety, with the tangy lemon and sweet blueberry flavors blending to create a deliciously strategic dessert experience.
