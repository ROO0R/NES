**Game Plot**: In "Xanac," you pilot the AFX-6502 Zanac fighter through twelve increasingly challenging levels to defeat the System, a corrupted artificial intelligence determined to eradicate humanity. Your mission takes you through various environments, each guarded by powerful bosses, as you uncover and disrupt the System's destructive plans. Unlike many shooters of its time, "Xanac" features a dynamic difficulty system that adjusts based on player performance, adding a unique narrative depth as if the System itself is learning and adapting to your tactics.

**What to Expect**: As you navigate your ship through enemy-infested space, you'll use the D-Pad to move in all directions, dodging bullets and obstacles. The A button fires your primary weapon, which can be upgraded by collecting power-ups, while the B button unleashes a powerful special attack, limited in supply but can be replenished. Each level introduces new enemy types and patterns, demanding quick reflexes and strategic use of your arsenal. Power-up selection is crucial, as different situations may call for specific weapon types. Mastering movement and attack patterns is key to surviving the intense battles ahead.

**TL;DR**: Pilot a ship, dodge and shoot, collect power-ups, defeat bosses.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Fly, shoot, upgrade, survive.
