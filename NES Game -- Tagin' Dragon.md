**Game Plot**: "Tagin' Dragon" is a simple yet captivating game where players control a dragon set in a mythical land. The objective is to grow your dragon by "tagging" (bumping into) smaller dragons scattered across various mazes. As you successfully tag these dragons, your own dragon's tail grows, making it increasingly difficult to navigate the maze without bumping into obstacles or your own tail. The game lacks a complex narrative, focusing instead on the challenge and excitement of the chase.

**What to Expect**: Upon starting "Tagin' Dragon", you'll be navigating your dragon through various mazes using the D-Pad to move up, down, left, and right. Your goal is to collide with smaller dragons to increase the length of your tail, which is done simply by moving into them. There are no buttons to press for attacking; your dragon automatically "tags" the smaller dragons upon contact. The challenge comes from avoiding walls and not running into your own ever-lengthening tail as you move through the maze. It's a test of spatial awareness and planning, as you'll need to think ahead to avoid trapping yourself.

**TL;DR**: Navigate mazes, grow your dragon by tagging others, avoid obstacles.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Grow dragon, avoid self and walls.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Dragon Tail Twisties*: These are pretzel sticks coated in a fiery cinnamon sugar, representing the growing tail of your dragon as you navigate the mazes of "Tagin' Dragon". The heat from the cinnamon symbolizes the dragon's fiery nature, while the twisty shape and crunchiness of the pretzel mimic the dragon's sinuous form and the excitement of the chase.
