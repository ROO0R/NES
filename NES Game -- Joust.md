**Game Controls**:
The D-pad moves the player's knight left or right. The A button flaps the knight's mount's wings to gain altitude. There are no attack buttons; defeating enemies is a matter of colliding with them while being at a higher elevation.

**Game Plot**: 
"Joust" does not have a conventional plot. Set in a fantasy world with floating platforms and lava pits, players take control of a knight riding a flying ostrich. The objective is to defeat waves of enemy knights riding buzzards. Victory in jousts is determined by altitude; the higher combatant knocks the opponent off their mount. Upon defeat, enemies drop eggs that can hatch into new foes if not collected quickly. The game includes cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, where two players can work together or duel against each other.

**What to Expect**: 
Expect fast-paced, arcade-style gameplay focusing on aerial maneuverability and timing. Players must navigate through the levels, strategically defeating enemies by outmaneuvering them and attacking from above. The game's simplicity in controls belies the depth of its challenge, especially as players advance through increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Coordination and quick reflexes are key, as is mastering the unique flight mechanics of your mount. "Joust" offers a mix of single-player challenges and multiplayer fun, making it a classic arcade experience.

**TL;DR**:
Fly, joust, and collect eggs in a fantastical arcade world.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: 
Arcade jousting on flying ostriches.

A massive omelette made from an ostrich egg, representing the eggs collected in "Joust". Filled with exotic meats and vegetables to mirror the game's fantastical setting, this *Ostrich Egg Omelette* is a hearty meal fit for a knight preparing for aerial combat. Served with a side of spicy sauce to add a bit of fire reminiscent of the lava pits in the game.

**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "The concept of jousting on birds was amusing but quite repetitive. It's interesting but not something I'd spend a lot of time on."
