**Inspired Food Item**: *Big's Busted Burger* 
A towering, spicy burger inspired by the "NARC" game, representing the fight against crime with its bold flavors. The patty is infused with hot sauce and topped with jalape√±os, crispy onion rings, and a special "bust sauce", all sandwiched between a black charcoal bun. It's a culinary challenge not for the faint of heart, symbolizing the battle against Mr. Big's spicy empire.
