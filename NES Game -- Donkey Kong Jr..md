**Game Plot**: In "Donkey Kong Jr.", the tables have turned from its predecessor, "Donkey Kong". Mario, traditionally the hero, plays the antagonist and has captured Donkey Kong. As Donkey Kong Jr., the player's mission is to navigate through various levels filled with traps, enemies, and obstacles to rescue his father from Mario's clutches. This game presents a unique twist by making Mario the villain, a rare role for him in the vast library of Nintendo games.

**Full Game Explanation**: "Donkey Kong Jr." is a classic platform game where players control Donkey Kong Jr. with the objective of rescuing his father from Mario. The game consists of four stages, each with unique challenges and enemies. Players must climb vines, jump platforms, and dodge enemies like snapjaws and birds to reach the key that unlocks Donkey Kong's cage. The game introduces climbing mechanics where Donkey Kong Jr. can grab two vines at once to climb faster or more slowly, adding a strategic element to the gameplay. Completing all four stages results in a reunion with Donkey Kong, after which the game restarts with increased difficulty.
