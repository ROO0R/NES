**Game Plot**: In "Bigfoot," players take the wheel of the iconic monster truck Bigfoot, competing in a series of races and car crushing events across America. The game does not have a traditional narrative or story but focuses on the thrill and excitement of monster truck competitions. As you progress, you aim to earn money from winning events, which can be used to upgrade your truck, enhancing its speed, durability, and performance in both races and car-crushing contests.

**What to Expect**: As the driver of Bigfoot, you'll be racing against other trucks and participating in car-crushing competitions. Use the D-Pad to steer your monster truck around the track or over rows of cars. The A button accelerates your truck, while the B button applies the brakes and helps you navigate tighter corners or stop for strategic positioning. You'll need to manage your truck's speed and direction carefully to outmaneuver your opponents in races and maximize damage in car-crushing events. Upgrading your truck is crucial, as better performance parts can significantly impact your success in later stages of the game.

**TL;DR**: Race and crush cars with your monster truck, upgrading it for better performance.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Monster truck racing and car crushing fun.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Bigfoot's Monster Burger* - This colossal burger is stacked with layers of beef, bacon, and cheese, towering over the plate like a monster truck over crushed cars. Each layer represents a different challenge in the game, from races to car-crushing events, with a side of "mud-splash" fries seasoned with a secret spice mix to mimic the dirt tracks of Bigfoot's races.
