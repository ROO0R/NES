**Game Plot**: Wally Bear and the No Gang is an educational game aimed at teaching children about the dangers of drug use and the importance of making positive life choices. Players take on the role of Wally Bear, a skateboard-riding bear who navigates through his neighborhood to gather his friends for a party at his grandparents' house. Along the way, Wally encounters various characters offering negative influences, and he must choose the right actions to avoid these dangers and spread positive messages.
