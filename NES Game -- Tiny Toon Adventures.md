Different levels may feature Buster's friends who provide special abilities: Plucky can glide over long distances, Dizzy can spin through barriers, and Furball can climb certain surfaces. The key to success is timing your jumps and attacks while mastering the unique abilities of Buster's friends to progress through the game.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Acme Acres Delight* - A colorful, layered gelatin dessert featuring flavors inspired by each character. The bottom layer is a tangy lemon for Buster's zesty personality, followed by a sweet strawberry layer for Babs' charm. A zippy lime layer represents Plucky's wit, and a rich blueberry layer stands for Dizzy's dizzying power. Topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of edible glitter, it's as adventurous and delightful as the game itself.
