**What to Expect**:
"Sword Master" is a game of skill and timing, combining action and platforming elements. You'll navigate through levels using the D-Pad to move your character left or right, and you'll need to crouch to dodge certain attacks by pressing Down. The A button allows you to jump over obstacles and pits, while the B button is used to swing your sword at enemies. Holding the B button charges a powerful magical attack, which can be released to deal significant damage to foes. Mastery of jumping, attacking, and using your magic is crucial to overcoming the challenges that lie ahead.

**TL;DR**: Navigate, jump, and slash your way through challenging levels, using magic to defeat powerful enemies.
