**Game Plot**: "Urban Champion" doesn't feature a narrative-driven plot; instead, it focuses on the gameplay experience of street fighting. Players take on the role of a fighter on city streets, challenging opponents in one-on-one battles. The objective is to knock the opponent into a manhole or off the screen through a series of punches and blocks. The game is set against the backdrop of a cityscape, with bystanders occasionally dropping items that can affect the fight. It's a straightforward contest of strength and timing, capturing the essence of early fighting games.

**What to Expect**: Players control their fighter using the D-Pad to move back and forth, with the A button to throw a light punch and the B button for a heavy punch. Timing and strategic use of light and heavy punches are crucial, as is dodging or blocking the opponent's attacks. The goal is to deplete the opponent's stamina and knock them back, ultimately pushing them into the manhole or off the screen to win the match. The game requires quick reflexes and a good understanding of when to attack and when to defend, offering a pure and simple fighting experience.

**TL;DR**: Street fight your way through opponents, knock them down.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Simple, straight-up street fighting.
