**Inspired Food Item**: *The Cosmic Calamari*
A space-themed dish inspired by "Image Fight", *The Cosmic Calamari* features squid rings marinated in a galaxy-colored glaze made from squid ink and various fruit juices, then lightly fried. Served with a side of "asteroid" potatoes and "nebula" sauce for dipping, this meal is as visually striking as it is delicious, offering a taste of the cosmic battlegrounds players navigate in the game.
