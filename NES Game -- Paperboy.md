In Paperboy, the D-pad controls the paperboy's movement left and right on the street and up and down on the sidewalk.

Paperboy follows the daily routine of a paperboy on a suburban street in the 1980s. The goal is to deliver newspapers to all the subscribers along the street while avoiding various obstacles and hazards like cars, pedestrians, and lawnmowers. The game spans over a week, starting from Monday and ending on Sunday, with the difficulty increasing each day. Players earn points by successfully delivering papers and lose subscribers for missed deliveries or damaging subscribers' houses. The ultimate aim is to keep as many subscribers as possible by the end of the week.
