**Inspired Food Item**: *Mushroom Kingdom Pie* - A savory pie filled with a variety of mushrooms, each layer representing a different realm of the Mushroom World. Topped with a layer of golden cheese as a nod to the game's coveted coins, this dish is as adventurous in flavor as Mario's quest is in the game.
