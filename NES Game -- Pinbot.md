**Game Controls**:
In Pinbot, the D-pad controls the left flippers, and the A or B button controls the right flippers. The goal is to score points by hitting various targets on the pinball table, using the flippers to keep the ball in play. The Start button is used to launch the ball into play and to pause the game.

**Game Plot**: 
Pinbot doesn't have a conventional storyline as it's based on the physical pinball machine of the same name. The objective revolves around activating the visor of the Pinbot, a robotic face in the center of the pinball table, by hitting specific targets. Once the visor opens, the player can lock balls for multi-ball play. The game includes various challenges and objectives typical of a pinball machine, such as lighting up lanes, hitting ramps for high scores, and achieving multi-ball play for bonus points.
