**Game Plot**: 
Blackjack on the NES doesn't feature a traditional plot or storyline. It's a digital adaptation of the classic card game known as Blackjack or 21. The objective is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21 points. It simulates the gambling experience, focusing on the card game itself rather than an overarching narrative. Players should expect a straightforward gambling simulation, aiming for the thrill of hitting 21 or standing at just the right moment to win against the dealer.

**What to Expect**: 
Playing Blackjack on the NES is akin to sitting at a casino table, but in the comfort of your own home. You'll use the D-Pad to navigate through the game's menu and make your bets. Pressing the A button will deal the cards, and also select 'Hit' to draw another card, or 'Stand' to hold your current total. If you wish to double down or split pairs, these options are also selected with the A button, guided by on-screen prompts. The B button is used to backtrack or undo an action if the game allows. It's a test of strategy and luck, with each round offering a new chance to outsmart the dealer.

**TL;DR**: Navigate menus with D-Pad, use A to hit/stand, B to undo. It's digital card gaming, NES style.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Bet, hit, stand, win. Simple casino fun on NES.
