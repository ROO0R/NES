**Game Plot**: 
In "Baby Boomer," players embark on a whimsical yet perilous adventure not commonly found in other games. Unlike typical shooters, this game centers around a wandering baby named Boomer, who's inexplicably left to navigate through treacherous landscapes filled with dangers. As the off-screen protector, your mission is to use your trusty light gun to clear obstacles, fend off menacing creatures, and create safe paths to guide Boomer through various levels ranging from caves to the Moon. There's no overarching narrative in the traditional sense; the game focuses more on the immediate challenge of keeping Boomer safe from the hazards that lie in his wandering path.

**What to Expect**: 
"Baby Boomer" is a light gun shooter where you'll use the NES Zapper to interact with the game. Unlike traditional shooters, you're not aiming at the baby but rather at obstacles and enemies that threaten his safety. You'll aim the Zapper at the screen and pull the trigger to shoot targets, clear paths, or activate switches and platforms to ensure Boomer's safety. Expect to aim at objects like balloons to help Boomer cross gaps, shoot enemies to protect him, and hit switches to modify the environment. Success hinges on your precision and quick reaction times to keep Boomer moving safely through each level.

**TL;DR**:
Use the NES Zapper to shoot obstacles and enemies, ensuring the baby's safety as he crawls through danger-filled levels.
