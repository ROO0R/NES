**What to Expect**: Battletoads is a side-scrolling beat 'em up that also incorporates platforming and racing elements. You'll control one of the toads, using the D-Pad to move and the A and B buttons for attacks and jumps. The game is notorious for its difficulty, requiring precise timing and quick reflexes. In combat, mash the B button to punch and kick, and use A for jumping over obstacles or dodging enemy attacks. Some levels include vehicle segments, where you'll need to navigate through hazards at high speed, using the D-Pad to steer and A button to jump over obstacles. Each level introduces new gameplay mechanics, so be ready to adapt quickly.

**TL;DR**: Engage in fast-paced combat, navigate through tricky levels, and overcome challenging obstacles with precise controls.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Punch, jump, and race your way through tough levels.
