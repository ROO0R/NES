The B button is for attacking enemies with your spear. Along your journey, you'll need to collect items and power-ups that enhance your abilities. Mastery of jump timing and attack patterns is crucial to defeat bosses and progress through the game. You're not just playing; you're embarking on a mythical quest that tests your reflexes and strategic thinking in a vibrant, pixelated world.
