**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "I thought 'Fantasy Zone' was going to be some sort of magical gardening game, but no, it's all about this little spaceship zipping around. I spent half the time just trying to figure out why my spaceship was shopping instead of, you know, space-shipping. They should've called it 'Space Mall Adventures' or something."
