Shredder organizes a tournament to lure the turtles out and finally defeat them in combat. Players can choose their favorite character from the TMNT universe, each with unique abilities and moves, to battle through various opponents in order to stop Shredder's evil plan and prove themselves as the ultimate fighter.

Combining directions with these buttons allows for special moves unique to each character, critical for turning the tide in close matches. Mastery over your character's move set and understanding your opponent's strategy are key to claiming victory.

**TL;DR**: Choose a character, master their moves, and fight to win in themed arenas.
