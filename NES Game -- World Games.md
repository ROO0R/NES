**What to Expect**: In "World Games", you'll be participating in a range of international sports challenges, each requiring different controls and strategies. For example, in the Weight Lifting event, you'll use the A button to control your grip strength and the B button to attempt the lift, all while balancing the athlete's stance with the D-Pad.

Each event uses a combination of the D-Pad, A, and B buttons for movements and actions, providing a unique challenge that tests your timing, precision, and quick learning skills. The game encourages mastering each sport's unique mechanics to achieve high scores and win medals.
