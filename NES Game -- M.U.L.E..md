**Game Plot**:
In M.U.L.E., players are colonists of the planet Irata (Atari spelled backwards), where they compete against each other to develop the most successful colony. This involves strategically claiming land, harvesting resources, and engaging in trade with other players. The goal is to amass the greatest wealth through smart resource management and economic strategy. The game does not have a traditional narrative but focuses on the dynamics of supply and demand, competition, and cooperation among players.

**What to Expect**:
M.U.L.E. is a pioneering resource management and economic strategy game. Players select plots of land to install M.U.L.E.s for extracting resources like food, energy, smithore, and crystite. Each resource has its purpose: food and energy are necessary for survival and operations, smithore is used to produce more M.U.L.E.s, and crystite is a valuable trade commodity. The game involves a balance of production, resource allocation, and trading in a market that fluctuates based on supply and demand. Players navigate menus to make decisions, trade with others, and strategize to outmaneuver competitors in economic warfare.

**TL;DR**: Manage resources, trade, and strategize to build the wealthiest colony on Irata.

**Inspired Food Item**: *The M.U.L.E. Burger*
A hearty, futuristic burger inspired by the game M.U.L.E., featuring a triple blend of meats to symbolize the multiple uses of M.U.L.E.s in the game. Stacked with layers of spicy space cheese, alien pickles, and a special Irata sauce, all between two cosmic sesame buns. It's a meal designed for the hungry colonist looking to refuel after a long day of resource management and trading.
