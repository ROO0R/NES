**Game Plot**: In Castelian, players take control of a small creature named Julius. Julius' mission is to dismantle eight towering castles filled with traps and enemies by planting bombs at their foundations. These castles have been overtaken by an evil presence, and it's up to Julius to navigate through the complex, spiraling levels to restore peace. The game sets up a fantastical world where each castle represents a unique environment and presents its own set of challenges and adversaries.

**What to Expect**: As Julius, you will be ascending each of the game's eight towers, moving from the bottom to the top. The towers rotate, and you must jump on platforms, avoid enemies, and dodge obstacles. Use the D-Pad to move Julius left or right and to align with the tower's rotation. Press A to jump over gaps or avoid hazards. Timing and precision are key, as falling off the platforms or colliding with enemies will cost you a life. The goal is to reach the top of each tower, plant the bomb, and escape before it detonates, all while navigating through the tower's rotating, maze-like structure.

**TL;DR**: Navigate rotating towers, avoid enemies, plant bombs at the top.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Climb, dodge, bomb.

**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "The game's quite a puzzle. It's like jumping on a spinning cake without touching the frosting. Not my cup of tea, but creative, I guess?"
