As Samus, you'll navigate through the cavernous depths of planet Zebes, battling space pirates and creatures. You'll need to jump, shoot, and use special abilities to progress. Finding power-ups like the Morph Ball and various beams will be crucial for accessing new areas and defeating stronger enemies. The game lacks a built-in map, so memorization or external help may be necessary to navigate the maze-like corridors.
