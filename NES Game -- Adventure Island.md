**What to Expect**: 
In "Adventure Island," you control Master Higgins, who is on a quest to save Princess Tina. You'll move Higgins with the D-Pad, guiding him through the levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The A button makes Higgins jump, which is crucial for dodging enemies and navigating the terrain. B button allows Higgins to throw weapons like axes and boomerangs, which you'll collect throughout your journey. Managing your health is vital; it constantly depletes, so keep an eye out for fruit to replenish it. Be prepared for a challenging yet rewarding experience as you explore diverse environments, from forests to caves, on your heroic rescue mission.

**TL;DR**: Navigate terrain, avoid enemies, collect fruit and weapons, save the princess.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jump, throw, eat fruit, rescue!
