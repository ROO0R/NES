The virus shows resistance, evolving defenses against your efforts, making each level a unique challenge.

This game is a mix of action and strategy, requiring players to navigate through the human body's different environments, like the bloodstream, lungs, and brain, to find and destroy the virus cells. The A button shoots the virus cells, and the B button is used to switch between different weapons or tools to adapt to the virus's evolving defenses. Moving the nano-robot with the D-pad, players must avoid or destroy obstacles and virus cells, manage resources like energy for special weapons, and plan the best approach to clear each level efficiently.
