**What to Expect**:
As you pick up the controller, you'll be diving into a blend of fighting action and exploration. Moving your character with the D-pad, you’ll navigate through the city, encountering various gangs. Use the A button to leap over obstacles or dodge attacks, and the B button to fight back with punches, kicks, or any weapon you pick up. Interacting with shops and eateries lets you purchase power-ups or food that heals you, using the money dropped by defeated foes. This game is as much about brawling as it is about strategy and item management to strengthen your character.

**TL;DR**: Explore River City, fight gangs, save Cyndi, improve your stats.
