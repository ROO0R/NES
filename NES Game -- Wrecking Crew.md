**Game Plot**: In "Wrecking Crew," players take on the role of Mario, not as a plumber, but as a demolition worker. The objective is to demolish buildings across various levels while avoiding enemies and hazards. Unlike other Mario games, there's no Princess Peach to save or Bowser to defeat. Instead, the focus is on strategic demolition. Each level is a puzzle where Mario must figure out the correct order to destroy obstacles and navigate through without getting trapped by enemies or obstacles.

**What to Expect**: You will be clearing levels by strategically demolishing all objects with your hammer while avoiding or trapping enemies. Use the D-Pad to move Mario around the construction site. Pressing the A button swings Mario's hammer to break walls, barriers, and other objects. There are no jump or run buttons, making timing and positioning crucial for avoiding enemies. Since some objects can't be destroyed, planning your path becomes key to not getting stuck. Success hinges on demolishing everything without getting caught by walking enemies or fireballs.

**TL;DR**: Demolish obstacles and avoid enemies in a construction setting, using strategic moves and a hammer.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Smash, avoid, strategize.
