**What to Expect**: Vice: Project Doom is a multi-genre game that primarily focuses on side-scrolling action. You'll navigate Hart through diverse environments, fighting enemies with a sword, a gun, and grenades. The D-Pad moves Hart, A jumps, and B attacks with your selected weapon, which can be swapped with the Select button. Besides platforming stages, expect first-person driving segments where you steer with the D-Pad, accelerate with A, and shoot or dodge obstacles with B. There are also rail-shooter sections, using the D-Pad to aim and B to fire. This mix provides a varied gameplay experience that keeps you engaged through its challenges.
