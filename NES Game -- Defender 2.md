**Game Plot**: "Defender II" (also known as "Stargate" in some versions) lacks a traditional narrative, focusing instead on the player's mission to defend against an alien invasion. The game sets the player in the cockpit of a spaceship tasked with protecting humanoids on the planet's surface from being abducted by alien forces. The player must navigate through waves of enemies, rescuing humanoids and defeating aliens to advance through levels.

**Full Game Explanation**: "Defender II" expands on its predecessor by introducing new enemy types and a warp mechanism that allows the player to teleport to different areas of the level to combat the alien threat more effectively. The game's challenge lies in managing the dual objective of offensive attacks against enemies while defensively ensuring the safety of humanoids on the ground. Failure to protect the humanoids results in the planet exploding, transforming the level into a dangerous, free-roaming battleground with increased difficulty.
