**Inspired Food Item**: *Donkey Kong Banana Split*  
A towering banana split that's as ambitious as climbing the highest level in "Donkey Kong". Three scoops of ice cream (banana, chocolate, and strawberry) piled high on a split banana, drizzled with hot fudge, sprinkled with nuts, and topped with a cherry and whipped cream. Just like the game, it's a classic challenge to finish!
