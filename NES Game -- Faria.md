**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "Oh, that game? 'Fairy Tale Adventure' or something... It was all swords and spells, quite the ordeal. I couldn't make head or tail of it, but Jeffrey seemed to enjoy it. It kept him busy for hours, so I guess it's got that going for it. Just make sure you remind your kids to take a break now and then. They can't all be knights and princesses, can they?"
