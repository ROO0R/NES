"The Karate Kid" video game is based on the popular 1984 film of the same name, continuing the story of Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi as they travel to Okinawa. The game features several levels that loosely follow the plot of the movie "The Karate Kid Part II". Players control Daniel-san through various challenges and fights, including a tournament in the Valley, street fights in Okinawa, and the final confrontation with Chozen. The game includes bonus stages that test skills such as catching flies with chopsticks and breaking ice blocks, aiming to capture the spirit and challenges of the film.

The game's difficulty can vary, with some sections requiring multiple attempts to master timing and combat techniques.
