**Game Plot**: In "Zombie Nation," the year is 1999 and Earth is under attack by an alien warlord, Darc Seed, who uses magnetic rays to turn the population into zombies and take control of their weapons. In an unexpected twist, the legendary samurai hero Namakubi heads to the United States to save the day. Instead of a traditional samurai, players control Namakubi's disembodied head, floating through the skies to rescue hostages and defeat Darc Seed's forces. The game is a journey through various American landscapes, battling enemy forces and ultimately confronting Darc Seed himself to free the Earth from his tyranny.

**What to Expect**: As you pilot Namakubi's head, you'll use the D-Pad to float across the screen, navigating through a barrage of enemies and obstacles. The A button unleashes your primary attack, a rapid-fire assault from your mouth, capable of destroying enemy minions and obstacles. Holding down the B button charges up a powerful attack, releasing a devastating energy blast to obliterate stronger foes. Your mission is to defeat enemies, dodge intricate patterns of attacks, and rescue hostages by simply touching them. It's a challenging blend of precision movement and strategic firing, with the added task of managing your health by absorbing enemy projectiles with your attacks.

**TL;DR**: Navigate as a floating head, shoot enemies, save hostages, defeat bosses.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Shoot. Dodge. Rescue. Boss fight.
