**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "I thought 'F-15 Strike Eagle' was going to be a documentary about birds or something. Turns out, it's all about flying planes and shooting stuff. Not really my cup of tea, but Jeffrey seemed to love it. I couldn't make heads or tails of it, kept crashing the plane. They should call it 'F-15 Strike Goose' for all the times I hit the ground!"
