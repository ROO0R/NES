**Game Plot**: "Wheel of Fortune" for the NES doesn't have a traditional plot or storyline, as it is a video game adaptation of the famous American TV game show with the same name. Players aim to solve word puzzles to win virtual cash and prizes by spinning a large carnival wheel. The anticipation of what the wheel will land onâ€”whether it be a fortune or a series of unfortunate eventsâ€”creates a unique thrill that mimics the excitement of the original TV show.

**What to Expect**: As a player, you will be simulating the experience of being a contestant on the "Wheel of Fortune" TV show. You'll use the D-Pad to select letters during your turn to guess the words or phrases on the puzzle board. Pressing the A button confirms your letter selection, while the B button is used to solve the puzzle once you think you know the full word or phrase. Your goal is to accumulate as much virtual money as possible by correctly solving puzzles. Each round requires strategic letter choices and sometimes a bit of luck when spinning the wheel.

**TL;DR**: Spin the wheel, select letters, and solve word puzzles to win virtual cash.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Spin, guess, solve, win!
