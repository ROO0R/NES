**Inspired Food Item**: *The Gretzky Slapshot Sundae* - A towering ice cream sundae layered with alternating scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, representing the icy rink and hockey pucks. Topped with whipped cream "snow", chocolate stick "hockey sticks", and a cherry "puck" on top. It's a delicious homage to the sweet victory and intense gameplay of Wayne Gretzky Hockey.
