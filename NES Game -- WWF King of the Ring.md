The game requires strategic thinking to decide when to attack, defend, or use a special move. Expect to engage in intense matches that require quick decision-making and fast reflexes to emerge as the King of the Ring.

**TL;DR**: Engage in strategic wrestling matches, using attacks, defenses, and special moves.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Wrestle, win, become King of the Ring.

**Inspired Food Item**: *The "Royal Rumble" Sandwich* - A towering sandwich stacked high with layers of beef, chicken, and bacon, symbolizing the strength and variety of the wrestlers in the game. Topped with a spicy "Ring of Fire" sauce, this sandwich is not for the faint of heart, much like the challenge of becoming the King of the Ring.
