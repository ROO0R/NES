**Inspired Food Item**: *Temporal Tacos* - A dish that takes you through the flavors of the ages. Each taco represents a different era visited in "StarTropics II: Zoda's Revenge", from the savory beef and beans of the Wild West, to the exotic spices of ancient Egypt, finishing with a Renaissance-inspired sweet and savory apple-pork filling. It's a culinary journey through time, just like Mike's adventure.
