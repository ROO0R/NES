**Inspired Food Item**: *One-Eyed Willy’s Pirate Booty Burgers* - These are juicy, treasure-filled beef burgers topped with golden melted cheese, a ring of pineapple for that tropical island flavor, and a special 'hidden' sauce that has a slight kick to it. Served on a toasted sesame bun, it’s a culinary adventure in every bite, reminiscent of the treasures and surprises found in "The Goonies" game.
