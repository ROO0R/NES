**Game Controls**:
In Pyramid, the D-pad moves the falling blocks left or right and rotates them to fit into the pyramid structure below. The A button is used to rotate the blocks, and the B button to speed up their descent. The goal is to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear, earning the player points and preventing the stack from reaching the top of the screen.

Pyramid does not have a narrative plot in the traditional sense, as it is a puzzle game focused on gameplay mechanics. However, it adopts an Egyptian theme, with the objective of clearing blocks to prevent them from stacking too high, akin to building a stable pyramid. The game's background and imagery draw inspiration from ancient Egyptian culture, adding an exotic aesthetic to the puzzle-solving gameplay.
