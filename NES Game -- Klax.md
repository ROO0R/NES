"Klax" features a simple yet addictive gameplay premise without a traditional story. The objective is to catch colored tiles that come down a conveyor belt and stack them in columns, rows, or diagonals of three or more of the same color to make them disappear, known as making a "Klax." The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses, with faster conveyor belts and more complex Klax patterns required to advance through levels. The challenge lies in managing the space effectively and planning for future tiles while dealing with the immediate need to clear tiles and prevent them from stacking too high.
