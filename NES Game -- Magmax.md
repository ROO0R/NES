**Game Controls**:
In Magmax, the game involves moving your vehicle/robot across the screen to dodge enemies and obstacles while firing at oncoming threats. The controls are straightforward: use the D-pad to move your vehicle in all directions, the A button to shoot your main weapon at enemies and obstacles, and the B button for special attacks or power-ups when available. The goal is to progress through levels by destroying enemies and avoiding damage.

**Game Plot**: 
"Magmax" doesn't feature a deeply developed plot, typical of many early NES games. The game is set in a futuristic world where players control a fighter vehicle capable of traversing both the surface of a planet and underground areas. The fighter can also be upgraded into a more powerful robot form by collecting parts scattered throughout the levels. The objective is to navigate through various terrains, battling waves of enemy robots and creatures, and ultimately defeat giant boss enemies that appear at the end of stages. The game's emphasis is on arcade-style action and shooting rather than storytelling.
