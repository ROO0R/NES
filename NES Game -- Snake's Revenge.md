**Inspired Food Item**: *Invisibility Cloak Calzone*
This dish is inspired by the stealth aspect of "Snake's Revenge." A calzone filled with spicy chicken, mozzarella, and a special "invisible" sauce that's clear but packed with flavor. The outside is dusted with a fine, edible shimmer to mimic the effect of being unseen, making it a fun and delicious nod to the game's espionage theme.
