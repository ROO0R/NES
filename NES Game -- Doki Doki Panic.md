#### "Super Mario Bros. 2" 

Super Mario Bros. 2 (the version released outside Japan) and Doki Doki Panic's differences stem from their development history, character selection, and game mechanics. Let's break down these differences:

1. **Development and Concept**:
   - "Doki Doki Panic" was originally developed for the "Family Computer Disk System" in Japan and was themed around the Fuji Television's Yume K≈çj≈ç '87 event, featuring characters from the event as the protagonists. It was not initially a Mario game.
   - "Super Mario Bros. 2" (released in North America and Europe) was adapted from "Doki Doki Panic" for Western audiences after the original Japanese version of "Super Mario Bros. 2" was deemed too difficult for those markets. The game was rebranded with Mario characters and certain adjustments to better fit the Mario series.

2. **Character Selection and Abilities**:
   - In "Doki Doki Panic," players can choose from four characters: Imajin, Mama, Papa, and Lina, each with unique abilities (Imajin is balanced, Mama can jump high, Papa is strong, and Lina can jump the highest).
   - In "Super Mario Bros. 2," these characters were replaced with Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach (Toadstool in some versions), and Toad, retaining the distinct abilities of their "Doki Doki Panic" counterparts. Mario is balanced, Luigi has high jumps, Peach can float, and Toad can pick up items quickly.

3. **Game Mechanics and Features**:
   - Some game mechanics were adjusted for "Super Mario Bros. 2," including the addition of a run feature and modifications to the game's physics to align more closely with expectations from the Mario series.
   - The character health system, power-ups, and the way enemies are defeated (picking up and throwing objects/enemies) were kept largely the same between both games, but "Super Mario Bros. 2" introduced elements more familiar to Mario fans, such as the use of warp zones.

4. **Visuals and Theming**:
   - While the core level designs and graphics of "Doki Doki Panic" were largely preserved in "Super Mario Bros. 2," character sprites, enemies, and some level elements were changed to match the Mario universe, including the introduction of familiar enemies like Shy Guys and Bob-ombs, which became staples in the Mario series.

5. **Cultural and Narrative Adjustments**:
   - The storyline was adapted in "Super Mario Bros. 2" to fit the Mario series, with Mario dreaming of a strange world that he later discovers is real. "Doki Doki Panic" features a story about a family saving children from a book.

These adjustments not only made "Super Mario Bros. 2" a unique entry in the Mario series but also introduced elements that would become iconic in future Mario games, demonstrating how a game originally developed with a completely different theme could be successfully integrated into one of the most famous video game franchises.
