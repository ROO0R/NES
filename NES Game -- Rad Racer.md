**Game Controls**:
In Rad Racer, players use the D-pad to steer their vehicle left or right, avoiding traffic and navigating through various terrains. The A button accelerates the car, while the B button is used for braking. Pressing down shifts the car into a higher gear for increased speed, and up shifts down for more control. Additionally, players can activate a turbo boost by pressing the select button, offering a burst of speed crucial for beating the clock.

Each course challenges players to navigate treacherous roads and traffic to reach checkpoints before time runs out, all while striving for the highest possible score. The goal is to complete each race as quickly as possible, mastering each unique course to become the ultimate Rad Racer.
