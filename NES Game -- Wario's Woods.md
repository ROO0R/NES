**Game Plot**: In Wario's Woods, Wario has taken over the peaceful Woods, filling it with monsters. Toad, the game's protagonist, takes it upon himself to save the Woods. The player helps Toad clear the forest by arranging monsters and bombs of the same color into rows, columns, or diagonals. As the game progresses, Wario periodically appears to interfere with Toad's efforts, adding to the challenge. The game stands out for being one of the few puzzle games featuring characters from the Mario universe and also for its unique gameplay that combines action with puzzle elements.

**What to Expect**: Wario's Woods is a fast-paced puzzle game where players control Toad, who must arrange differently colored monsters and bombs to clear them from the playing field. Using the D-Pad, players move Toad around the bottom of the screen, picking up and placing objects with the A button and rotating them with the B button. The goal is to match at least three objects of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to remove them. The game requires quick thinking and strategy to arrange the objects efficiently, especially as the game speeds up and Wario adds more obstacles. It's an engaging mix of action and puzzle-solving that challenges both reflexes and mental agility.

**TL;DR**: Toad clears monsters in a puzzle game with action elements.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Match colors, beat Wario, save the woods.
