**Game Controls**:
In Space Shuttle Project, you'll navigate your shuttle through various phases of a space mission, from liftoff to landing. Use the D-Pad to control the shuttle's position during launch, in orbit, and landing procedures. The A button is used to activate engines, make selections in the mission control interface, and interact with objects in space. B button functions vary by mission stage, including deploying satellites, managing speed, and initiating landing sequences. Mastering the controls requires patience and precision, reflecting the real-life complexities of space travel.

**What to Expect**: 
When you start Space Shuttle Project, you're immediately placed in the role of an astronaut in charge of critical missions. Initially, you'll focus on successfully launching the shuttle by managing fuel levels and trajectory using the D-Pad to steer and A button to control thrust. In orbit, you'll deploy satellites and conduct experiments with precise D-Pad movements and A button for deploying or interacting with mission-specific objects. Landing requires careful deceleration and alignment, pressing A to decrease speed and using the D-Pad for navigation. Throughout the game, timing and precision are your allies, as you navigate through the different stages of each space mission.

**TL;DR**: Navigate, deploy, conduct, and land in simulated NASA missions.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Space shuttle sim with real mission goals.
