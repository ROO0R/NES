The A button lets you jump, crucial for dodging obstacles or reaching high platforms. Pressing B throws ninja stars, your primary attack. Holding down B charges a special attack, unique to each level, that can clear screens or deal significant damage. The game combines stealth elements with direct combat, encouraging a balance between aggressive action and strategic retreat. Expect to use stealth to bypass enemies or engage them head-on with your ninja arsenal.
