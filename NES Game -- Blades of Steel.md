Players choose a team and compete against an opponent, aiming for the championship in a straightforward sports simulation. The game's focus is on the excitement of the hockey match, rather than storytelling. Expect competitive matches that capture the essence of hockey without a narrative-driven experience.

If a fight breaks out, you'll use A and B to punch and defend. The game is a test of your sports strategy, reflexes, and timing, all set to the thrilling pace of a professional hockey match.

**TL;DR**: Control your team, pass, shoot, and fight your way to victory in exciting hockey matches.
