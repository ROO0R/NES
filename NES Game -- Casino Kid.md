**Game Plot**: In "Casino Kid", you play as a young casino hopeful in the fictional town of Lost Wages (a play on Las Vegas), aiming to become the King of the Casino. The game revolves around navigating through various casino games, including blackjack and poker, to beat certain characters and gain access to new challenges. Unlike most gambling games that focus solely on the mechanics of the game, "Casino Kid" incorporates a storyline where you must prove your worth against casino bosses to advance. The ultimate goal is to challenge and defeat the Casino King himself, thereby earning the title of the new Casino King.

**What to Expect**: As you step into the shoes of Casino Kid, you'll be navigating through crowded casino floors to challenge rivals at blackjack and poker tables. Using the D-Pad, you'll move around the casino, talking to characters with the A button to initiate games or gather hints. In blackjack, you'll use the A button to hit (take another card) and the B button to stand (keep your current hand), aiming to get as close to 21 without going over. In poker, these buttons will help you make bets, call (match the current bet), or fold (give up the hand). It's a test of strategy, memory, and luck as you aim to outplay your opponents and manage your in-game money wisely.

**TL;DR**: Navigate casinos, play blackjack and poker, defeat opponents to become Casino King.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Win card games, conquer the casino.
