**Game Plot**: In "Commando," you play as Super Joe, an elite soldier on a mission to fight his way through enemy lines and destroy the opposing army's fortifications. The game is set in an unspecified jungle warfare scenario where Super Joe must single-handedly take on waves of enemies with nothing but his trusty rifle and a finite supply of grenades. As you progress, the challenges become harder, and the enemies more relentless, but the goal remains the same: advance through enemy territory and bring down their forces.

**What to Expect**: You'll be guiding Super Joe through various enemy territories, moving up the screen while dodging bullets and obstacles. Use the D-Pad to move in all directions, A to fire your rifle, and B to throw grenades. Your main objective is to survive the onslaught of enemy forces, destroy enemy bases, and make it to the end of each level. Expect to constantly move and shoot, as staying still for too long will make you an easy target. Timing your grenade throws to take out groups of enemies or hard-to-reach targets is crucial for advancing.

**TL;DR**: Move, shoot, dodge, and use grenades to survive against waves of enemies.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Blast through enemies, stay alive!

Filled with a rich chocolate ganache and a hint of spice to represent the thrill and intensity of battle, it's topped with a green tea frosting to cool down after a heated play session.
