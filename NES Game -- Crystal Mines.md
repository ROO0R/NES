The A button activates your laser to mine crystals and defend against hostile creatures, while B lays down bombs to remove obstacles and enemies. Navigating through the puzzles requires strategic planning and quick reflexes to avoid traps and solve environmental puzzles. Expect to manage resources carefully, as your energy and bomb supplies are limited. Mastering movement and efficient use of your tools is key to uncovering all the game's secrets and successfully completing your mission.
