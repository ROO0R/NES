**Game Plot**: In "Trog," players enter a prehistoric world as one of two dinosaurs, Bloop and Spike, on a mission to collect eggs scattered throughout various mazes. The goal is to grab all the eggs to advance to the next level while avoiding being eaten by the Trog, a group of comically inept cavemen. As the dinosaurs progress, they'll face increasingly complex mazes and smarter Trogs. This game combines a playful take on prehistory with arcade-style fun, emphasizing quick thinking and faster reflexes.

**What to Expect**: You'll be guiding your dinosaur through intricate mazes to collect eggs and avoid capture by the Trogs. Use the D-Pad for navigation and there are no other button requirements, keeping gameplay simple yet engaging. As you collect eggs, power-ups become available, transforming your dinosaur into a fire-breathing beast or granting invincibility for a short period. Mastering maze navigation and timing your power-up usage is crucial for survival. Expect a mix of strategic planning and split-second decision making as you aim to outsmart the Trogs and progress through levels.

**TL;DR**: Navigate mazes, avoid Trogs, collect eggs, and use power-ups.
