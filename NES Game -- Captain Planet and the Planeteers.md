**What to Expect**: As a player, you'll control the Planeteers, switching between them to use their elemental powers: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Heart. The D-Pad moves your character, while the A button jumps and the B button activates your current Planeteer's special ability (e.g., launching fireballs or creating gusts of wind). Levels require using these powers to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and navigate through environmental hazards. Success hinges on understanding which power to use and when, encouraging strategic thinking and environmental awareness.

**TL;DR**: Use elemental powers to overcome puzzles and beat eco-villains in themed levels.
