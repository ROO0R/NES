**Game Plot**: In "Batman Returns", based on the film of the same name, you control Batman as he fights to save Gotham City from the Penguin, who seeks to take control of the city through a campaign of terror and manipulation. The game's story follows the movie's plot closely, with Batman battling against the Penguin's henchmen, the Red Triangle Circus Gang, and facing Catwoman. The narrative unfolds through a series of beat 'em up levels, driving sections, and platforming challenges, all set against the dark, atmospheric backdrop of Gotham City at Christmas time.

**What to Expect**: You'll take on the role of Batman, navigating through the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, fighting off thugs with a combination of punches, kicks, and gadgets. Use the D-Pad to move Batman, A button to jump, and B button to attack. Holding down the B button allows Batman to unleash a powerful attack, but use it wisely as it leaves you temporarily vulnerable. The Select button cycles through Batman's gadgets, like the grappling hook and batarang, which you activate with the B button. Expect to use strategy and quick reflexes to overcome enemies and obstacles in your path to confront the Penguin and save the city.

**TL;DR**: Fight as Batman through Gotham, using punches, kicks, and gadgets against foes.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Beat up Gotham's baddies as Batman.
