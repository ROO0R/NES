**What to Expect**: 
In "Xevious," you're at the helm of the Solvalou ship, soaring through enemy territory. Your main controls are the D-Pad for movement across the screen, the A button to fire air-to-air missiles for airborne enemies, and the B button to deploy bombs on ground targets. The key to survival lies in dodging a barrage of enemy fire while accurately targeting foes both in the air and on the ground. You'll need to master quick reflexes and strategic planning, balancing offensive strikes with evasive maneuvers to progress through the increasingly difficult levels.

**TL;DR**: Navigate, shoot, bomb, and dodge your way through enemy forces in a vertical scrolling shooter.
