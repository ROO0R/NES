**Game Plot**: In "Tiger-Heli," you pilot the titular attack helicopter on a mission to defeat enemy forces and protect your homeland. The game does not heavily focus on a narrative but instead places emphasis on the action and challenges you encounter. As you fly over various terrains, including cities, rivers, and enemy bases, the objective is straightforward: destroy as many enemy units as possible while dodging incoming fire to survive and achieve high scores.

**What to Expect**: "Tiger-Heli" is a top-down shooter where you control a helicopter moving vertically up the screen. Using the D-Pad, you'll navigate your helicopter, avoiding enemy bullets and obstacles. The A button fires your primary weapon, destroying enemy tanks, helicopters, and structures. The B button releases a bomb, causing massive area damage, ideal for clearing tricky sections. The game rewards precision and quick reflexes, as you'll need to dodge between enemy fire and strategically use your bombs to survive. Expect fast-paced action that tests your shooting and evasion skills.

**TL;DR**: Pilot a helicopter, shoot enemies, use bombs wisely, and avoid being hit.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Shoot, dodge, bomb, survive!
