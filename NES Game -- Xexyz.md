**Game Plot**: Xexyz is set in the futuristic world of the year 2777, where different islands float in the sky, each ruled by a malevolent mechanical being. The game's protagonist, Apollo, is on a quest to defeat these rulers, rescue captive princesses, and ultimately save the world of Xexyz from destruction. As players progress, they uncover the game's lore, encountering various allies and enemies that add depth to the narrative. The blend of fantasy and science fiction elements creates a unique story backdrop, inviting players into a world of adventure and heroism.

**What to Expect**: In Xexyz, you'll be jumping and shooting through platforming stages, battling enemies, and solving simple puzzles. Use the D-Pad to move Apollo around, A button to jump, and B button to shoot enemies. Some stages involve piloting a mech, where A still jumps (or flies in this context) and B shoots different projectiles. The game combines exploration with action, as you'll need to navigate through levels, find key items, and defeat bosses to progress. Each island ends with a boss battle, requiring you to learn patterns and exploit weaknesses.

**TL;DR**: Platforming, shooting, mech-flying action in a futuristic fantasy world.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jump, shoot, fly, save the world.
