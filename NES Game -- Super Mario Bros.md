**What to Expect**: As Mario, your primary goal is to traverse from the left side of the screen to the right, overcoming obstacles and enemies along the way. You'll use the D-Pad for movement: left and right to move Mario, and down to duck or enter pipes. The A button allows Mario to jump, which is essential for avoiding enemies, breaking blocks, and reaching higher platforms. The B button is used to run or shoot fireballs when Mario is powered up. Collecting mushrooms makes you bigger, while flowers grant the ability to shoot fireballs. The gameplay is intuitive, focusing on timing, precision, and exploration to discover secret areas and collect coins.
