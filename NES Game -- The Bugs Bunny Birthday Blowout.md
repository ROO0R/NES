Despite being the star, Bugs finds out that his Looney Tunes friends are jealous and not invited to his birthday party. To reach his party, Bugs must traverse through six different levels, each filled with obstacles and enemies, including his friends trying to stop him. Along the way, Bugs collects carrots that serve as currency and faces off against several boss characters in a quest to celebrate his big day.
