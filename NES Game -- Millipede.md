**Game Controls**:

**Game Plot**: 
In "Millipede," players defend the garden against an invasion of millipedes, spiders, mosquitoes, and other insects. As a sequel to "Centipede," the game adds new enemies and challenges, but the core objective remains the same: destroy the millipede as it winds down the playfield towards you, navigating through a field of mushrooms. Each segment of the millipede becomes a mushroom when shot, adding to the complexity of the battlefield.

**What to Expect**: 
You'll be constantly moving your blaster left and right along the bottom of the screen, aiming and shooting upwards at the descending millipede and other enemies. Shooting breaks the millipede into smaller segments, and fully clearing a millipede advances you to the next level with increased difficulty. Avoid enemy attacks and use mushrooms to your strategic advantage, shooting them for points and clear paths.

**TL;DR**: Shoot the millipede, dodge enemies, clear levels.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Shoot, dodge, advance.
