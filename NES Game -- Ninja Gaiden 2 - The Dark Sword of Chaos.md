**Inspired Food Item**: *Shadow Clone Sushi Roll*
This inventive sushi roll, inspired by the shadow clones Ryu can summon in the game, features a trio of flavors wrapped in a single roll. Inside, spicy tuna represents Ryu's fiery determination, avocado for the stealthy smoothness of a ninja, and tempura crunch for the sharpness of ninja skills.
