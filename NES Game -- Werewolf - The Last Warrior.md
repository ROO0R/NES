**Game Plot**: In "Werewolf: The Last Warrior", the player is thrust into a post-apocalyptic world where a mad scientist named Dr. Faryan has taken over and plans to transform humanity into werewolves under his control. You play as Ken, one of the last remaining warriors who has the power to resist the scientist's influence and transform into a werewolf himself. Your quest is to defeat Dr. Faryan and his minions, rescue your captured comrades, and bring peace back to the world. Expect a story filled with transformations, battles against formidable foes, and the struggle between man and beast.

**What to Expect**: You will embark on a side-scrolling adventure filled with enemies to fight and obstacles to overcome. As Ken, you use the D-Pad for movement, including crouching and jumping. The A button lets you jump, crucial for avoiding enemies or reaching higher platforms. The B button is used for attacking, which changes depending on whether you're in human or werewolf form. Collecting special 'W' icons transforms Ken into his powerful werewolf counterpart, enhancing your abilities and attack range. In this form, you also gain the ability to stick to and climb walls, allowing for new ways to explore levels. The game combines fast-paced action with platforming challenges, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking to progress.

**TL;DR**: Transform into a werewolf, beat enemies, climb walls, and save the world.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Wolf out, fight, climb, win.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Full Moon Beef Burgers*: A hearty dish inspired by the game, these burgers are made with the finest ground beef and a hint of wild herbs to bring out the beastly appetite in anyone. Topped with a slice of cheese that melts perfectly under a broiler, resembling a full moon resting atop a dark, meaty landscape. The burger is served on a toasted bun with a side of 'clawed' fries, hand-cut and fried to a golden crisp.
