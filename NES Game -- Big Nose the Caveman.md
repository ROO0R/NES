**Inspired Food Item**: *Caveman's Crunchy Club Sandwich*. A towering sandwich with layers of roasted dinosaur meat (chicken for us modern folks), wild leaves, and berries, served between giant slices of stone-baked bread. Topped with a "club" skewer holding everything together, it's a delicious homage to Big Nose's adventure and diet.
