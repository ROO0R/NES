**What to Expect**: This game is a light gun shooter where you'll use the NES Zapper to aim and shoot at the screen. When facing an outlaw, the screen will prompt "FIRE" indicating it's time to draw your gun and shoot. Aim the Zapper at the screen and pull the trigger to fire at the outlaw. Accuracy and speed are key; you must shoot the outlaw before they shoot you. There's no need for button presses other than pulling the trigger on the Zapper. It's a straightforward test of your quick-draw skills in a virtual Old West setting.

**TL;DR**: Aim fast and shoot first using the NES Zapper to outdraw outlaws.
