"Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters" is a turn-based strategy game where players assume the role of military and scientific units trying to defend Earth from Godzilla and other kaiju.

**Inspired Food Item**: 
*Monster Mash Sushi Roll* - This sushi roll is an explosive mix of fiery sriracha tuna, crispy tempura flakes, and avocado, wrapped in nori and topped with a dollop of wasabi mayo to represent the chaotic energy of the kaiju battles. Each bite delivers a burst of flavor that's as unpredictable as the monsters it's inspired by.
