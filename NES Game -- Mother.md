**Inspired Food Item**: *Alien Parfait*
A layered dessert that starts with a base of green pistachio pudding, symbolizing the alien influence in the game. The next layer is a rich, blueberry compote, representing the vastness of space. Topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed galaxy-themed candy bars for a touch of cosmic wonder. The *Alien Parfait* is a sweet tribute to the game's blend of the ordinary and the extraordinary.
