**Game Controls**:
In Pro Wrestling for the NES, players use the D-pad to move their wrestler around the ring. The A button is used for basic attacks like punches and kicks, while the B button performs grapples, which can lead to a variety of wrestling moves depending on the direction pressed on the D-pad. Combining the D-pad directions with button presses allows players to execute different moves, from body slams to dropkicks, crucial for defeating opponents and winning matches.
