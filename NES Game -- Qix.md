**Game Controls**:
In Qix, the player uses the D-pad to move the marker along the edges of the playfield and presses either the A or B button to draw Stix, which are lines used to capture territory. Players must avoid the Qix, a wandering line that moves about the screen, and Sparx, which travel along the Stix and edges. The goal is to fill a certain percentage of the screen without being hit by these obstacles.

**Game Plot**: 
Qix does not feature a conventional narrative or storyline. The game's focus is on gameplay mechanics, where the objective is to claim territory on the screen while avoiding the Qix and Sparx. The Qix floats around the playing field unpredictably, and the player must use strategy and timing to draw boxes and sections off parts of the screen. The challenge and "plot" of the game evolve through the player's attempts to secure the playing field and achieve high scores, representing a battle of wits and reflexes against the game's AI.

**What to Expect**: 
Expect a game that tests both your strategic thinking and your ability to act under pressure. You'll need to carefully plan your movements and draw territories while constantly avoiding the Qix and Sparx. The game requires a balance between being aggressive enough to claim large areas of the screen for points and being cautious to not get trapped or touched by enemies. It's a simple concept that offers deep gameplay, with each level increasing in difficulty and complexity. Players should be prepared for a challenging yet addictive experience that rewards patience and precision.
