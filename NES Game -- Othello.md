**Game Controls**:
In Othello for the NES, players use the D-pad to move the cursor over the desired square on the board. The A button places a piece on the board, flipping any of the opponent's pieces that are caught between the piece you placed and any of your other pieces, in any direction. The B button is used to pass your turn, applicable in situations where no valid moves are available.

Players take turns placing their pieces with the goal of capturing the opponent's pieces between their newly placed piece and another of their pieces, thereby flipping the captured pieces to their color.
