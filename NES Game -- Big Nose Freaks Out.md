**Inspired Food Item**: *Caveman's Crunchy Club Sandwich*
Imagine a towering triple-layered sandwich, each layer packed with fire-grilled meats - think wild boar bacon, dinosaur ham, and mammoth turkey. Stuffed between slabs of stone-baked bread, the Caveman's Crunchy Club also boasts layers of fresh, leafy greens, sliced tomatoes, and a hearty drizzle of 'lava' hot sauce, all skewered together with a mini wooden club. It's a prehistoric feast fit for a hungry adventurer!
