**Inspired Food Item**: *Submarine Sandwich Supreme*
A hearty, multi-layered submarine sandwich packed with flavors. Imagine layers of turkey, roast beef, and a special "torpedo" hot sauce that gives it a spicy kick, all topped with lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of sea salt to bring the oceanic theme full circle. Served in a long, submarine-shaped bread, it's a tribute to the tactical depth and intensity of "Silent Service."
