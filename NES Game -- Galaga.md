**Game Plot**: 
In "Galaga," players command a spaceship tasked with defending Earth from waves of alien attackers. The game lacks a narrative story, focusing instead on the challenge of achieving high scores by destroying enemy ships. The aliens deploy in formation at the start of each level, then dive down in attempts to crash into the player's ship or shoot it down. "Galaga" introduced new gameplay elements to the shoot 'em up genre, such as the ability for enemies to capture the player's ship with a tractor beam, which could then be rescued for dual firepower.
