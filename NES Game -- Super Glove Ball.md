**Game Plot**: In "Super Glove Ball", players dive into a futuristic virtual reality world, aiming to navigate through a series of 3D mazes and challenges. Unlike traditional shooters or action games, the narrative focuses on the use of a virtual glove to interact with and manipulate objects in the game's environment. Players are tasked with the goal of overcoming obstacles and solving puzzles to progress through levels, making it a unique blend of action and strategy.

**What to Expect**: You'll be using the NES Power Glove or the standard controller to interact with objects in a 3D space. With the Power Glove, movements of your hand control the in-game glove, grabbing and throwing balls to break blocks or solve puzzles. If using the standard controller, the D-Pad moves your glove around, A button grabs, and B button throws balls. Expect a mix of physical coordination (if using the Power Glove) and traditional button pressing, requiring precise timing and spatial awareness to progress.

**TL;DR**: Use hand movements or controller to manipulate a virtual glove, breaking blocks and solving puzzles in 3D space.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Glove control, break blocks, solve puzzles.
