**Inspired Food Item**: *Spectral Dumplings*
These are *steamed dumplings* with a twistâ€”each dumpling is filled with a spicy ghost pepper-infused pork mixture, wrapped in a translucent dough that makes them appear almost ghostly. Served with a side of soy sauce and chili oil, these dumplings offer a daring culinary adventure that captures the spirit of Phantom Fighter's ghostly battles.
