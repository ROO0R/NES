**What to Expect**: 
"Section Z" is a side-scrolling shooter where you'll be constantly moving and dodging enemy attacks. Pressing the D-pad left or right moves your astronaut in those directions, while the A button fires your primary weapon towards the direction you're facing. The game doesn't use the B button for firing; instead, it might have other uses depending on the game's context or power-ups. The objective is to reach the end of each section by navigating through enemies and obstacles. You'll encounter various enemies, each with unique patterns that you'll need to learn to progress. No jumping or platforming is involved; it's all about flying, shooting, and dodging.

**TL;DR**:
Fly, dodge, and shoot through space sections to save Earth from aliens.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: 
Space shooting adventure with lots of dodging.
