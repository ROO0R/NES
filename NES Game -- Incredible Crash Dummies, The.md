"The Incredible Crash Dummies" is based on the popular toy line and animated series featuring anthropomorphic crash test dummies used in safety tests. In the game, players control Slick and Spin, two crash dummies on a mission to thwart the evil plans of the main antagonist, Junkman, who is creating dangerous machines that threaten their world. The narrative involves navigating through various levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and hazards that reflect the theme of vehicular safety and crash testing. The game emphasizes slapstick humor and the resilience of the dummies, who lose limbs when damaged but can continue their mission until completely incapacitated.

The game requires precise jumping, timing, and use of attacks to progress. It's an entertaining take on the platform genre, with humor and a unique aesthetic drawn from the crash dummy universe.
