Use the D-pad to control player movement on the field and to navigate menu options. The A button is used to swing the bat, pitch the ball (with direction controlled by the D-pad), and make field players jump. The B button is used for base running, throwing the ball to the desired base (direction determined by the D-pad), and to select pitch type while pitching. Start pauses the game and selects menu options.
