This unique partnership forms the core of their quest to save Blobolonia from its bitter ruler.

**What to Expect**: This game is a unique mix of puzzle-solving and platforming. You'll navigate through various environments, using a selection of jelly beans to transform your blob companion into useful tools or objects. For example, feeding your blob a licorice jelly bean turns it into a ladder, while a strawberry jelly bean transforms it into a bridge. You'll use the D-Pad to move the boy and select jelly beans with the Select button, then feed them to the blob with the A button. Transforming the blob strategically to overcome obstacles is key to your success. Expect to experiment with jelly bean flavors and their corresponding transformations to solve puzzles and progress through the game.

**TL;DR**: Navigate and solve puzzles by transforming your blob with jelly beans.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jelly beans + Blob = Adventure!
