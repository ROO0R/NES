**Game Plot**: "T&C Surf Design" doesn't have a traditional storyline or plot. It's based on the T&C (Town and Country) Surf Designs' mascot characters, Thrilla Gorilla and Joe Cool, engaging in skateboarding and surfing challenges. Players step into the shoes (or on the boards) of these characters, navigating through various levels that capture the essence of extreme board sports culture of the 80s.

**What to Expect**: You'll be alternating between surfing and skateboarding events. In the skateboarding section, use the D-Pad to navigate the street, avoiding obstacles like potholes and roadblocks. Press A to jump over these obstacles and B to perform a quick speed boost. For the surfing portion, the D-Pad also controls your movement on the wave, A helps you perform tricks in the air, and B adjusts your surfing speed. Both segments require timing and skill to avoid wiping out and to score high points.

**TL;DR**: Master skateboarding and surfing, avoid obstacles, and perform tricks for points.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Skate and surf, dodge, jump, and trick!
