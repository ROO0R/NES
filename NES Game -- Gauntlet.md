**Inspired Food Item**: *The Gauntlet Goblet*
A hearty, medieval-themed stew served in a bread bowl, designed to replenish the strength of any dungeon crawler. The stew is filled with chunks of beef, root vegetables, and a rich, savory broth, symbolizing the game's mix of characters and the challenges they face. Topped with a sprinkle of cheese and a side of "magic potion" (a berry-based drink), it offers both sustenance and the spirit of adventure found in "Gauntlet".
