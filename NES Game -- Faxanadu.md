**MISTER RADS COOL TIPS AND TRICKS SECTION**: Get ready to kick some monster butt in "Faxanadu", where timing and strategy are your best friends! Sharpen your reflexes because dodging and jumping are just as important as swinging your sword. Keep an eye on your health and magic meters; running out of either in the middle of a dungeon is a no-go. Gold is golden, so save up for those big upgrades that'll turn you into a monster-slaying machine. Secrets are everywhere‚Äîif a wall looks funny, it might just be hiding something. Dive deep into this adventure, and remember, the fate of the World Tree is in your hands!

**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "Well, I picked up this 'Fancy Axeman' game for Jeffrey. All that jumping around and fighting with creatures was a bit too much for me. I couldn't make heads or tails of it, but Jeffrey seemed to enjoy it. Why can't these games be more like the puzzles in the newspaper?"
