Players navigate through a series of challenges and obstacles that mirror key plot points from the film, such as the iconic clock tower scene and the final train sequence. The narrative aims to capture the essence of time travel's perils and the urgency of altering historical events to ensure a safe return to the present.

**Inspired Food Item**: *McFly Pie* - A sweet and savory pie inspired by the Wild West, featuring a hearty filling of slow-cooked beef and beans, topped with a layer of apple pie filling beneath a flaky crust. The dual layers represent the merging of past and present, much like Marty's adventures in 1885 and his life in the 1980s.
