**Game Plot**: 
In "Rescue: The Embassy Mission," you're part of an elite commando team tasked with rescuing hostages from a heavily guarded enemy embassy. Starting outside the embassy, you must first navigate through the surrounding area without being detected by enemy spotlights. Once inside, the game shifts to a side-scrolling action, where you must disarm bombs and engage in shootouts with terrorists to reach the hostages. The ultimate goal is to safely extract all hostages and exit the embassy, highlighting themes of bravery, strategy, and teamwork.

**What to Expect**: Initially, you'll sneak your way to the embassy, avoiding spotlights by running (D-pad) and hiding (A to crouch/lie down). Failure here means starting over, so patience and timing are key. Inside, the game becomes more action-oriented; you'll use the D-pad to navigate corridors, A to interact with doors and disarm bombs, and B to shoot enemies. Expect a mix of stealth and action, with a need for both quick reflexes and strategic planning. 

**TL;DR**: Sneak past spotlights, then action-packed rescue inside the embassy.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Stealth, then shoot and rescue.
