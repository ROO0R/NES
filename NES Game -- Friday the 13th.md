**Inspired Food Item**: *The Crystal Lake Freeze*
A chilling, deep blue slush drink with gummy "fish" swimming below the surface and topped with a "machete" skewer of maraschino cherries, representing Jason's relentless pursuit in the murky depths of Crystal Lake. This icy treat is both a nod to the chilling atmosphere of the game and a way to cool down after the adrenaline-pumping action.
