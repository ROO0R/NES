**What to Expect**: Sqoon is a side-scrolling shooter where you control a submarine navigating through treacherous waters filled with enemies and obstacles. The D-Pad moves the submarine in all four directions, allowing for precise positioning. Pressing the A button fires your primary weapon to attack enemy crafts and obstacles, while the B button releases bombs for destroying underwater targets. Collecting power-ups enhances your weapons and restores health. Success hinges on dodging enemy attacks, strategically using your arsenal, and saving prisoners. Expect a blend of fast-paced action and strategic decision-making as you progress through each level.
