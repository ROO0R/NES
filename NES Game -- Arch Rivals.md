**Game Plot**: In "Arch Rivals," players dive into a highly exaggerated, over-the-top arcade basketball experience where the main goal is to outscore the opponent in a game of two-on-two basketball. Unlike traditional basketball games, "Arch Rivals" focuses less on the rules and more on the chaotic interactions between players. It's set in a world where basketball is not just a game but an all-out brawl for the basket, allowing players to punch opponents to steal the ball, showcasing a humorous take on the competitive spirit of basketball.

**What to Expect**: "Arch Rivals" simplifies basketball to its core elements: scoring points and stopping your opponent from doing the same, but with a twist of physical comedy and arcade fun. You'll use the D-Pad for moving your player around the court. The A button lets you punch (to attempt to steal the ball from your opponent) and shoot (when you have the ball). The B button is used for passing the ball to your teammate and jumping (for defense or to catch rebounds). Expect to spend most of your time dodging your opponent's punches, trying to steal the ball, and scoring hoops in a very unconventional and hilarious manner.

**TL;DR**: Arcade basketball with a focus on humor and physical interactions, easy to pick up and play.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Punch, pass, shoot, laugh.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Slam Dunk Sundae*: A towering sundae featuring layers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, interspersed with chunks of brownie and cookie dough. Topped with whipped cream, a cherry, and drizzled with a raspberry coulis to mimic the look of a basketball going through a hoop. It's as chaotic and satisfying as dunking on your opponents in "Arch Rivals."
