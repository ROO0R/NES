**What to Expect**: 
Assuming the mantle of one of the four Avengers, you'll navigate through levels teeming with enemies. Using the D-Pad, move your character across the screen, dodging attacks and positioning yourself strategically. The A button unleashes standard attacks‚Äîfists for Captain America and Hawkeye, energy blasts for Iron Man and Vision. Pressing B activates your character's special ability, like Cap's shield throw or Iron Man's repulsor rays, consuming a bit of your power meter. Combining movement and attacks efficiently is key to defeating waves of enemies and progressing through the game. Expect to switch between characters to utilize their unique abilities and overcome specific challenges.

**TL;DR**: Navigate, attack with A, special moves with B; character switch for strategy.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Fight, dodge, use specials, switch heroes.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Avenger's Assemble Sundae*
Imagine a towering sundae, each layer representing an Avenger from the game. Captain America's blueberry ice cream topped with a star-shaped strawberry, Iron Man's mango sorbet with fiery red raspberry coulis, Hawkeye's lemon ice cream with a sprinkle of purple candy shards, and Vision's vibrant green mint ice cream, all piled high. Topped with whipped cream and a miniature American flag, it's a dessert that unites flavors as seamlessly as the Avengers unite to fight evil.
