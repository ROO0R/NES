It features three popular NES games: Super Mario Bros., Rad Racer, and Tetris. Players are challenged to score as many points as possible within a time limit across these games. In Super Mario Bros., the goal is to collect 50 coins as quickly as possible. Rad Racer then tests the player's racing skills on a designated course, and finally, Tetris challenges players to score points by clearing lines. The cartridge was designed to find the best all-around gamer by testing different gaming skills.
