**Game Plot**: 
Bases Loaded doesn't have a traditional plot or storyline as it focuses on delivering a baseball simulation experience. Players take control of one of the 12 teams within the game, striving to win in a season of baseball. The game does not follow real-life teams or players but instead creates a unique league within its universe, where the ultimate goal is to become the champion by defeating all other teams.

**What to Expect**: 
In Bases Loaded, you'll be immersing yourself in the classic baseball experience, taking turns playing offense and defense. On offense, use the D-Pad to aim your bat and press A to swing at the right moment to hit the ball. When running bases, use the D-Pad to control the direction of your runners. On defense, you'll pitch by pressing A to throw the ball and use the D-Pad to control the pitch's direction. B allows you to pick off runners, change pitchers, or make defensive plays. You'll need to manage your team's lineup and decide when to hit, pitch, or make strategic plays to outmaneuver your opponents.

**TL;DR**: Swing bats, pitch balls, and run bases in a classic NES baseball simulation.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Hit, pitch, run, repeat.
