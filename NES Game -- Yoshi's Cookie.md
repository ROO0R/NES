**Game Plot**: In "Yoshi's Cookie," there isn't a traditional narrative or deep plot to follow. The game centers around a simple yet addictive puzzle mechanic involving Yoshi and a plethora of delightful cookies. Players align these cookies to clear them from the board and progress through levels. The primary goal is to match cookies of the same type in rows or columns to make them disappear, akin to baking a perfect batch of cookies in a magical kitchen inspired by Yoshi's universe.

Using the D-Pad, you move the cursor to select a cookie, then press A to choose a cookie to swap with an adjacent one, aiming to align three or more cookies of the same type horizontally or vertically. B is used to rotate the order of cookies in a row or column to help you create matches. As levels progress, the game introduces new challenges and faster pacing, demanding quick thinking and faster movements.

**TL;DR**: Match cookies in rows or columns to clear the board, using strategic swaps and rotations.
