**Game Plot**: 
"Ice Hockey" by Nintendo is a straightforward simulation of the ice hockey sport, allowing players to engage in a fast-paced game on the ice. There isn't a narrative storyline in the traditional sense, as the focus is on the sports action. Players select a team represented by a country and compete in matches against the computer or another player. The game is notable for allowing players to customize their team by selecting the number of heavy, medium, and light players, each type having distinct advantages and disadvantages, adding a layer of strategy to team composition.

**What to Expect**: 
Expect a fun and engaging ice hockey simulation where you control a team of players with different attributes: heavy players are slow but strong, light players are fast but weak, and medium players offer a balance. Gameplay involves strategic passing, shooting, and positioning to outscore your opponent. The game's controls are simple but require practice to master shooting angles and defensive maneuvers. It's a game that's easy to pick up for a quick match but offers depth for those who wish to master its mechanics.

**TL;DR**:
Competitive ice hockey game with team customization options.

Fast-paced hockey with strategic team setup.
