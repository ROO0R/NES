**Game Controls**:
RBI Baseball 2 offers a straightforward control scheme typical for NES sports titles. Use the D-pad to move players and navigate menus. The A button swings the bat, pitches the ball (with direction and speed depending on how long it's held down), and confirms menu selections. The B button controls base running, allowing players to advance or retreat, and it also serves to cancel menu selections. While pitching, players can use the D-pad to control the ball's direction.
