**Inspired Food Item**: *The Cat Burglar's Delight*
A sneaky, yet sophisticated snack, *The Cat Burglar's Delight* consists of a layered dip that mimics the complexities of a heist. Starting with a base of cream cheese (the foundation of every good plan), followed by layers of spicy salsa (the thrill of the heist), guacamole (the reward), and topped with shredded cheese and olives (the escape into the night). Served with a side of stealthy black tortilla chips, it's the perfect snack for plotting your next playful caper.
