Lord Blackthorn, influenced by the evil Shadowlords, has twisted the Eight Virtues into a regime of tyranny, corrupting the essence of what it means to live by these principles. The player, as the Avatar, must navigate a world where the virtues have been perverted, gather companions, and confront the Shadowlords to restore the true Virtues and free Lord British from his imprisonment. This entry in the series focuses on the consequences of power and corruption, challenging players to make difficult choices in a morally complex world.
