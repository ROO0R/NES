**Game Plot**: Anticipation doesn't follow a traditional plot or storyline. Instead, it's a digital board game that combines elements of drawing and puzzle-solving. Players advance on a game board by correctly identifying drawings, which range from simple objects to more complex concepts. The game is designed to be a party experience, offering a variety of difficulty levels to accommodate players of all ages and skill levels.

**What to Expect**: In Anticipation, you'll navigate a colorful game board using the D-Pad to roll a virtual dice and move your piece accordingly. When it's your turn, an image will slowly begin to draw itself on the screen, and you must guess what it is before it's fully completed using the D-Pad to select letters and pressing A to confirm your guesses. There are different categories of drawings, and correctly guessing a drawing allows you to advance further on the board. The game is competitive, with the goal to be the first to complete all categories. With simple controls but challenging puzzles, expect a mix of quick thinking and strategy as you try to outguess your opponents.

**TL;DR**: Navigate game board, guess drawings to advance, first to finish wins.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Board game + drawing guessing challenge.
