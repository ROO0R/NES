**What to Expect**: As you play "Circus Charlie," you'll be engaging in a series of mini-games that simulate classic circus acts. Using the D-Pad, you'll move Charlie around the circus arena, with each mini-game requiring different movements. Pressing the A button will make Charlie jump, which is crucial for avoiding obstacles like fire rings, monkeys, and balancing balls. The B button isn't used in this game, simplifying the control scheme. Your main goal is to time your jumps perfectly and move accurately to avoid failing the act and to score as many points as possible.
