In "Moon Ranger," the player is tasked with the mission of saving Earth from an impending doom brought by an alien force planning to detonate a bomb on the moon's core.

Your goal is to reach the end of each level, defeat the boss, and progress through the story to save the moon and Earth from destruction.
