**What to Expect**: In "Track & Field II", you'll engage in a series of Olympic sports events, each requiring unique control schemes. For sprinting events, rapidly alternate pressing the A and B buttons to run; for jumping and throwing events, use a combination of the D-Pad to angle your jump or throw, and the A or B button for power. Success hinges on your timing, speed, and strategic use of controls specific to each event. From fencing, where you press A to attack and the D-Pad to move or dodge, to swimming, where rhythmic pressing of A and B in coordination with the D-Pad directs your swimmer, you'll be immersed in a diverse athletic experience.

**TL;DR**: Master various Olympic events through quick reflexes and strategic use of the NES controller.
