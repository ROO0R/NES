**Game Controls**:
In Q-bert, players use the D-pad to move the character diagonally across a pyramid of cubes. The goal is to change the color of every cube by hopping onto them, while avoiding enemies. There are no attack controls, as the primary mechanism involves dodging and leading enemies away using the unique isometric perspective.

**Game Plot**: 
Q-bert does not have a traditional narrative or plot. The game's core focus is on the titular character, Q-bert, who must hop on cubes to change their color. The objective is to convert all cubes to the target color to advance to the next level. This simple yet addictive gameplay is set against a backdrop of increasingly complex levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Q-bert's world is abstract, emphasizing puzzle-solving and quick reflexes over a storyline.
