**Game Controls**:
In RBI Baseball, players use the D-pad for moving the cursor in the menu, positioning fielders, or directing base runners. The A button is used to swing the bat, pitch the ball (with directional influence for curveballs), and throw the ball to bases while fielding. The B button allows for bunts when batting, selects different types of pitches, and can be used to initiate steals while on base. Controlling your players effectively requires timing and precision, especially when pitching and batting.

**Game Plot**: 
RBI Baseball doesn't have a narrative plot. It simulates the experience of playing baseball with teams that were based on real MLB teams and players from the mid-1980s, thanks to its MLBPA license. Players select a team and play through a baseball game, attempting to outscore their opponent through hitting and pitching. The game features a season mode where players can try to take their chosen team to win the championship.
