**What to Expect**:
In "Adventure Island 2," you'll be exploring a colorful, side-scrolling world. The D-Pad moves Master Higgins left or right, while the A button makes him jump over obstacles or enemies. The B button is used to throw weapons, like axes or boomerangs, which you'll collect throughout your journey. The game features a variety of levels, each with its own unique enemies and challenges. You'll also find eggs that contain power-ups, bonus points, or even dinosaurs you can ride, each with its own special ability. The goal is to reach the end of each level before your health meter, which constantly depletes over time, runs out. Eating fruit scattered throughout the levels replenishes your health.

**TL;DR**:
Explore islands, avoid or defeat enemies, collect power-ups, and ride dinosaurs to save Master Higgins' beloved.
