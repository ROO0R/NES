**Game Controls**:
Move the left and right flippers using the D-pad (left side for left flipper, right or A button for right flipper). Use the B button to launch the ball into play. The game's controls are straightforward, focusing on timing and flipper control to keep the ball in play and hit targets for high scores.

**Game Plot**: 
Rollerball doesn't have a traditional plot or story as it's a pinball simulation game. Players are thrust into a high-stakes world of pinball where the primary goal is to score as many points as possible by hitting various targets on the table. The game focuses on the arcade experience, providing an intense pinball challenge rather than a narrative-driven adventure.

**What to Expect**: Imagine you're stepping up to a grand pinball machine, but it's all on your NES controller. You'll spend your time pressing buttons to flip those flippers, aiming to hit targets, bumpers, and pass through lanes to rack up your score. Expect a game where quick reflexes and strategic planning on when to hit the ball are key. You'll use the D-pad to control the flippers on the left and either the right part of the D-pad or the A button for the right flipper, while the B button serves to launch your ball into play from the outset.

**TL;DR**: Aim, flip, and score points in a virtual pinball adventure.
