You'll use the D-Pad to select letters from the on-screen keyboard and press A to confirm your choices. If you think you know the puzzle's solution, you can choose to solve it by selecting the letters that form the word or phrase. Success requires a good vocabulary and the ability to guess phrases based on incomplete information. You'll also spin a virtual wheel to determine cash or prizes for correct guesses or risk losing a turn.

**TL;DR**: Spin the wheel, guess letters, solve puzzles, win virtual cash.
