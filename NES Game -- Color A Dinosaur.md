**Game Plot**: "Color A Dinosaur" is a game that lacks a traditional storyline or plot. Instead, it offers a digital canvas for players, especially young ones, to express their creativity. The game revolves around coloring pre-drawn images of various dinosaurs. It is designed to be an educational tool, allowing children to learn about dinosaurs in a fun, engaging way. The absence of a narrative shifts the focus to the act of coloring and the exploration of creativity rather than progressing through a storyline.

**What to Expect**: Upon starting "Color A Dinosaur", you'll find yourself in a menu to select a dinosaur outline to color. Using the D-Pad, you can navigate through a selection of dinosaurs. Pressing the A button selects a dinosaur and brings you to the coloring screen. Here, the D-Pad moves the cursor over different parts of the dinosaur. Pressing A again fills the selected area with color. B button cycles through the available colors, allowing for customization of your dinosaur masterpiece. There is no right or wrong way to color; the game encourages experimentation and creativity.

**TL;DR**: Navigate menus and select dinosaurs with the D-Pad, color them using A, and switch colors with B.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Pick, point, color, change color.
