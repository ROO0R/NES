**Game Plot**: In "Boulder Dash", players control Rockford, a brave prospector venturing through a series of caves to collect valuable gems. The game does not have a traditional storyline but focuses on the challenge and strategy of navigating through each cave within a time limit. Players must avoid various hazards such as falling boulders and enemy creatures while strategizing the best paths to collect all gems and unlock the exit to proceed to the next level.

**What to Expect**: "Boulder Dash" tasks you with guiding Rockford through underground mazes filled with falling boulders and deadly creatures. Use the D-Pad to move Rockford in all four directions. Youâ€™ll dig through dirt to create paths, collect gems by walking over them, and carefully plan your moves to avoid getting crushed by boulders or caught by enemies. Timing and strategy are crucial; boulders fall when the dirt below them is removed, creating both hazards and potential solutions. Your goal in each level is to collect the required number of gems before heading to the exit, which appears once you've collected enough gems.

**TL;DR**: Navigate mazes, collect gems, avoid hazards, and use strategy to solve puzzles.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Collect gems, dodge boulders, outsmart enemies.
