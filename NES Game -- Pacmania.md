**Game Plot**: 
Pac-Mania revisits the classic Pac-Man formula with a fresh twist: a pseudo-3D perspective and the new ability for Pac-Man to jump over ghosts. Set in the familiar maze-like environment, players guide Pac-Man to eat all the dots while avoiding or consuming the four ghosts that roam the maze. Power pellets allow Pac-Man to turn the tables and eat the ghosts for a brief period. The game introduces new mazes and enhanced ghost behaviors, but the core objective remains the same: clear the maze of dots and avoid being caught.
