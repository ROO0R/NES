**Game Plot**: In "Time Lord", players embark on a journey through time to stop an alien race from manipulating history to conquer the Earth. Starting in the year 2999, the player must travel to various historical periods, including medieval times, the wild west, and World War II, to collect orbs that will allow them to advance to the next time period. The ultimate goal is to return all historical events to their rightful timeline before the year 3000, when the alien invasion becomes unstoppable.
