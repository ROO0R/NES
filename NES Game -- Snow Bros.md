This game is a platformer where your main action is to defeat enemies by encasing them in snow and then rolling them away. Use the D-Pad to move left or right and to climb up and down ladders. Press A to jump over obstacles or enemies, and press B to shoot snow. Holding B longer allows you to create bigger snowballs that can take out multiple enemies. Your goal is to clear all enemies on the screen to advance to the next level. It's fast-paced and requires quick reflexes to dodge enemies while trapping them in snow.
