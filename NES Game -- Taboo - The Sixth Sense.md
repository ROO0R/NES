**Game Plot**: "Taboo - The Sixth Sense" doesn't follow a traditional game plot or storyline. Instead, it offers players a digital tarot reading experience. Upon starting the game, players are prompted to enter their name and a question they wish to have answered. The game then simulates a tarot card reading, drawing cards and laying them out in a specific spread to provide insight or predictions based on traditional tarot card interpretations. While it lacks a narrative or characters, it presents a unique use of the video game medium to explore the mystical and the occult.

Once your question is set, you'll press the A button to initiate the reading. The game then automatically shuffles and draws cards, presenting them on the screen alongside interpretations. There's no need for rapid button presses or complex inputs; your role is more of an observer, watching as the game unveils the cards and their meanings.
