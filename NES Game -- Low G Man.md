**Inspired Food Item**: *Low G Gelato*
This is a multi-layered gelato, each layer flavored and colored to represent the different levels in "Low G Man". Starting with a vibrant blueberry layer for the icy stages, followed by a tangy lemon for the electric zones, and a rich chocolate for the industrial levels. Topped with popping candy to mimic the game's explosive action, this dessert is a delight for both the eyes and the palate, offering a cool, refreshing taste with every spoonful.
