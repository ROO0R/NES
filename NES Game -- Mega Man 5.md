**Game Plot**: In "Mega Man 5," the world is once again under threat, but this time by a new villain named Protoman, Mega Man's brother. Protoman has kidnapped Dr. Light and unleashed a new army of Robot Masters to wreak havoc. Mega Man must defeat each Robot Master, gain their unique weapons, and use them to navigate through a series of challenging levels. The journey to rescue Dr. Light and confront Protoman takes Mega Man across a variety of environments, facing numerous enemies and obstacles along the way.

**What to Expect**: "Mega Man 5" is a classic action platformer where you'll navigate through levels, jumping over gaps and shooting enemies. You start with the Mega Buster, a basic weapon, but defeating bosses grants you new weapons with unique abilities. You'll need to switch between these weapons to exploit enemy weaknesses and overcome obstacles. For a quick session, focus on learning enemy patterns and mastering the jump-and-shoot mechanics. Experiment with different weapons to find the most effective one for each situation.

**TL;DR**: Defeat bosses, collect weapons, jump, and shoot your way through levels.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jump, shoot, collect boss weapons, defeat Protoman.

**Inspired Food Item**: *Mega Man Energy Tank Shake* - A vibrant, electric blue milkshake topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of edible glitter, symbolizing Mega Man's energy restoration. This shake is not only a visual tribute to the iconic Energy Tanks in the game but also offers a sweet, refreshing boost, much like the in-game item's effect on Mega Man's health.
