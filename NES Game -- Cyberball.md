**Game Plot**: In the futuristic world of Cyberball, traditional American football has been replaced by a high-stakes game played by robots. Teams compete in a dangerous sport where the football is a ticking time bomb that can explode if not passed over the midfield line before the timer runs out. The objective remains to score touchdowns, but with the added thrill and peril of managing a bomb instead of a regular ball. This game combines the strategy of football with the intensity of managing explosive risks, set against a backdrop of futuristic competition.

The B button will allow you to switch between players, kick the ball, and make strategic moves to avoid the ball (the bomb) from exploding. Mastery of quick decision-making and strategic play-calling is key to victory, blending traditional football tactics with the unique challenge of managing an explosive ball to avoid detonation.
