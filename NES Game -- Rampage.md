**Game Controls**:
In Rampage, players control gigantic monsters aiming to destroy cities across the USA. The D-pad moves the monster horizontally across buildings and vertically to climb. The A button makes the monster punch buildings or enemies, and the B button jumps. Players can also press both buttons simultaneously for a special attack. The goal is to demolish every building on the screen while avoiding military attacks and consuming various items for health.

**Game Plot**: 
Rampage features three monsters: George (a giant ape), Lizzie (a dinosaur), and Ralph (a giant wolf), who were humans transformed by various means. The game lacks a detailed narrative, focusing instead on the trio's rampage through 128 cities across the United States. As players destroy each city, they move on to the next, facing increasing military resistance. The game's arcade style emphasizes destruction and mayhem over a storyline.

**What to Expect**: 
Expect a lighthearted, destruction-filled arcade experience. Players will spend their time climbing buildings, punching them into rubble, and fighting off military forces trying to stop their rampage. Eating items like food for health or avoiding hazards like dynamite adds a layer of strategy. Rampage is best enjoyed with friends in its cooperative multiplayer mode, where players can compete or work together to destroy the city more efficiently.

**TL;DR**:
Monsters destroy cities; eat for health, avoid military attacks.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: 
Become monster, smash cities, dodge bullets, have fun.
