**Game Plot**: In "Xenophobe", players find themselves in a future where alien infestation threatens the galaxy's space stations. The mission is clear: select your hero from a diverse group, each with unique abilities, and clear the infested stations by any means necessary. As you traverse through different sections of each station, your goal is to eliminate the alien threat, collect valuable items for points, and ensure the safety of the galaxy. Expect a plot that's light on narrative but heavy on action, as the primary focus is on the eradication of the alien menace and survival against increasing odds.

**What to Expect**: As you embark on your mission to cleanse the space stations of aliens, you'll use the D-Pad to move your character through the station's corridors. The A button fires your weapon at the relentless alien horde, while the B button lets you pick up items, weapons, and health packs scattered throughout the level. Your objective is to clear each section of aliens before the time runs out or the station self-destructs, all while managing your character's health and ammunition. Cooperation with other players (if any) can enhance your survival chances, making strategic positioning and resource sharing key elements of gameplay.

**TL;DR**: Navigate space stations, blast aliens, collect items, survive.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Alien blasting survival.
