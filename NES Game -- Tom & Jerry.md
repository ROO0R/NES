**Game Plot**: In this classic adaptation of the timeless cat and mouse rivalry, you play as Jerry, the clever little mouse, on a mission to navigate through various environments of a typical household, collecting cheese and avoiding traps set by Tom, the persistent cat. Each level is a new part of the house, from the kitchen to the attic, each with its own set of challenges and puzzles. Jerry's goal is to outsmart Tom and reach safety, all while the household setting adds a familiar yet adventurous backdrop to the chase.

**What to Expect**: As Jerry, your main goal is to navigate through levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and puzzles. You'll use the D-Pad to move Jerry around the screen, avoiding Tom and other dangers. The A button allows Jerry to jump over obstacles and onto platforms, while the B button is used to interact with objects or use items you find along the way, such as marbles to trip up Tom or temporary speed boosts. Strategic thinking and quick reflexes are key, as you'll need to solve puzzles to unlock doors or find hidden paths that lead to safety and the next level.

**TL;DR**: Navigate as Jerry through the house, avoid Tom, solve puzzles, and collect cheese.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Run, jump, puzzle-solve as Jerry.
