**Game Plot**: In "Adventure Island 3", the hero Master Higgins continues his quest, this time to rescue his girlfriend Tina, who has been abducted by a new alien invader. The journey takes him across a series of islands, each with its own unique environment and set of challenges. Higgins must navigate through forests, mountains, and caves, battling wildlife and enemy agents sent by the alien force. The story is simple but compelling, driving players to guide Higgins through perilous landscapes to save his beloved.

**What to Expect**: Players control Master Higgins, a nimble islander on a rescue mission. The D-Pad moves Higgins left or right and crouches. Press A to jump, navigating over obstacles and enemies; holding it longer makes Higgins jump higher. B throws weapons like boomerangs, axes, or fires the dinosaur companion's special attack, depending on the power-up obtained. The gameplay is a blend of action and precision platforming, requiring quick reflexes and strategy to progress. Enemies and hazards are plentiful, but so are helpful items and dinosaur friends that provide unique abilities, making exploration and combat diverse and engaging.

**TL;DR**: Navigate islands, defeat enemies, save Tina with jumps and weapons.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Rescue mission with jumps and power-ups.
