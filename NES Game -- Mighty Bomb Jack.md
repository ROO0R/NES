**Game Controls**:
In Mighty Bomb Jack, players control Jack, who can jump and float. The A button makes Jack jump, and if pressed again while in the air, allows him to open his cloak and slow his fall. The B button has no function in this game. Movement is controlled with the D-pad, guiding Jack through various rooms filled with bombs, enemies, and treasures.

**Game Plot**:
Mighty Bomb Jack takes place in the fantastical kingdom of Pamera, where the royal family has been kidnapped by the demon Belzebut and held captive in a pyramid. Jack, the protagonist, must brave the pyramid's many rooms, collecting bombs and treasures, to rescue the royal family and defeat Belzebut. The game is not heavily plot-driven but focuses on the arcade action and puzzle-solving elements within the pyramid's many chambers.

**What to Expect**:
As a player, you will navigate through various levels divided into rooms, collecting bombs before they explode while avoiding enemies. The game features a unique mechanic where collecting too many power-ups can lead to being sent to a "torture room" where you must survive without collecting any coins. The goal is to reach the end of each level, ultimately rescuing the royal family. You'll be using the D-pad to move Jack and the A button to jump and glide. Timing and precision are crucial, as is strategic planning to avoid unnecessary power-ups.

**TL;DR**: Navigate, collect, avoid enemies, and solve puzzles to rescue the royal family.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jump, collect bombs, save royals.
