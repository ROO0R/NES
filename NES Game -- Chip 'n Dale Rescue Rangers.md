**What to Expect**: You'll control Chip or Dale (or both in co-op mode) navigating through intricate levels filled with obstacles and enemies. The D-Pad moves your character, A jumps, and B picks up or throws objects which can be used to defeat enemies or solve puzzles. Holding B also allows you to carry items that are crucial for overcoming obstacles. Your journey involves strategic thinking to utilize objects and allies you find along the way effectively. The game is a blend of fast-paced platforming action and puzzle-solving that requires both reflexes and a bit of brainpower.
