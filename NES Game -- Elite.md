Jumping into the most dangerous systems can net you the biggest profitsâ€”if you can survive the pirate swarms. ðŸ’¥ Keep an eye on market trends to buy low and sell high, and don't be afraid to run from a fight if the odds aren't in your favor. Upgrading your ship is key; more cargo space means more loot, and better weapons mean less trouble from those pesky pirates. Dive into the unknown, and maybe you'll emerge as the galaxy's next Elite!
