**Game Plot**: "Classic Concentration" doesn't have a traditional storyline or plot as it's based on the television game show of the same name. Players participate in a digital version of the show, where the main goal is to match pairs of cards on a board to reveal pieces of a rebus puzzle underneath. The player who solves the puzzle first wins the round and earns the chance to solve the final puzzle to win prizes. The game is designed to test memory skills and the ability to solve visual puzzles.

**What to Expect**: In "Classic Concentration," you will be using the D-Pad to navigate a board filled with hidden pairs of prizes. Pressing the A button selects a square, revealing the prize or puzzle piece underneath. Your task is to remember what each revealed card shows and where it is to make successful matches on subsequent turns. Making a match removes those cards from the board and reveals part of the rebus puzzle beneath. Use the A button again to guess the solution to the puzzle once enough of it has been revealed. This game requires memory and puzzle-solving skills to match pairs and solve the rebus puzzles.

**TL;DR**: Navigate, remember, match pairs, and solve visual puzzles with the D-Pad and A button.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Match, solve, win!

**Inspired Food Item**: *Memory Match Muffins*. These are muffins with various hidden fillings, each pair in a batch containing the same filling. Eating one gives you a taste, but remembering which one matches the flavor rewards you with the satisfaction of finding a perfect pair, much like the game itself.
