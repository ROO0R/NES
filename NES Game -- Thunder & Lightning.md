**Game Plot**: In "Thunder & Lightning," players find themselves in the midst of an epic confrontation between two titular deities: Thunder, the protector of the realm, and Lightning, a renegade deity bent on chaos. The player takes on the role of a hero chosen by Thunder to wield a magical paddle, tasked with deflecting balls of energy to destroy blocks and various mythical creatures summoned by Lightning, in a quest to restore peace to the realm. As players progress, they unravel the mythic conflict between these powerful forces, leading to intense block-breaking battles across various stages.

**What to Expect**: When playing "Thunder & Lightning," you'll control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, moving it left and right with the D-Pad to keep a ball in play. The A button releases the ball at the start of each level or can activate special power-ups you collect. The goal is to break all the blocks on the screen without letting the ball pass your paddle. Along the way, you'll encounter enemies and power-ups that can either aid or challenge your progress. Mastering the movement of your paddle and timing your power-up uses are key to overcoming the game's challenges and defeating Lightning's minions.

**TL;DR**: Move the paddle to break blocks, avoid losing the ball, defeat enemies, and use power-ups wisely.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Paddle, ball, break blocks, don't lose.
