**Game Plot**: In a post-nuclear world, the player embarks on a quest to recover eight jewels, known as the "8 Eyes," to restore balance and peace. The game's hero, Orin the Falconer, accompanied by his faithful falcon, Cutrus, travels through various countries to retrieve these jewels from the dukes who have seized them after the great war. Each jewel has a unique power and is heavily guarded in the dukes' castles. The journey is fraught with challenges, as Orin must overcome the mutated remnants of humanity and the guardians of the jewels to restore the Earth's balance.

**What to Expect**: As Orin, you'll navigate through eight different castles filled with traps, puzzles, and enemies. You'll use the D-Pad to move Orin and jump over obstacles or gaps. The A button is used to attack with Orin's sword, while the B button lets you summon Cutrus, your falcon, to attack enemies or retrieve items. Coordination between Orin and Cutrus is crucial for solving puzzles and defeating bosses. Each castle ends with a boss fight that requires strategy and understanding of each boss‚Äôs weakness, which often involves using the correct jewel power obtained from previous castles.

**TL;DR**: Explore castles, solve puzzles, fight bosses with your falcon, and collect jewels.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Adventure with falcon, fight, puzzle, collect jewels.
