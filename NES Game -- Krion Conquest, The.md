The game unfolds across five distinct stages, each culminating in a challenging boss fight. Francesca's journey is filled with enemies, traps, and puzzles that test the player's platforming and combat skills. Unlike many games of its era, it features a spell-casting system that adds a strategic layer to the action-platforming gameplay.
