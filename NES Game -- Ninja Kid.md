**Game Plot**: 
Ninja Kid, known in Japan as "GeGeGe no Kitaro: Youkai Daimakyou", is loosely based on the manga and anime series "GeGeGe no Kitaro". In the game, the player takes on the role of a young ninja tasked with defeating various monsters and spirits plaguing the land. The journey spans several levels, each set in different environments filled with unique enemies. The ultimate goal is to defeat the boss at the end of each level, progressing through the game to restore peace to the world. While the international release stripped most references to "GeGeGe no Kitaro", the essence of battling supernatural forces remains.
