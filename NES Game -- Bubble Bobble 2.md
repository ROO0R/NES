**What to Expect**: This game invites players into a vibrant world where they'll use the D-Pad to move Bubby or Bobby across platforms. The A button makes the character jump, crucial for dodging enemies and reaching higher grounds. Pressing B emits bubbles; these capture enemies, which can then be popped for points or to reveal power-ups by bumping into them. Each level is a puzzle of sorts, with the goal to defeat all enemies to advance. Itâ€™s a mix of strategic placement and quick reflexes, with the additional challenge of finding and freeing trapped friends for bonus rewards.

**TL;DR**: Navigate platforms, trap enemies in bubbles, and pop them to progress through levels and rescue friends.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: Jump, bubble, pop, rescue!
