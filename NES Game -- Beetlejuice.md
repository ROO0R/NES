**Game Plot**: 
In "Beetlejuice" for the NES, players dive into the whimsically macabre world inspired by Tim Burton's film. The game loosely follows the movie's plot, focusing on Beetlejuice's quest to scare away the Deetz family from their home. As the self-proclaimed "bio-exorcist," players navigate through various levels filled with supernatural and bizarre challenges, trying to outwit and frighten the new homeowners and their supernatural investigator. It's a story of mischief, mayhem, and ghostly antics, all through the lens of Burton's unique gothic comedy.
