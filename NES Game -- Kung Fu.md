**Game Plot**: 
In "Kung Fu", players take on the role of Thomas, a martial artist who must rescue his girlfriend, Sylvia, from the clutches of the mysterious villain, Mr. X. To save her, Thomas must fight his way through five floors of the Devil's Temple, each filled with a variety of henchmen, including knife throwers, snakes, and dragons. Each floor ends with a boss fight, culminating in a final battle against Mr. X himself. The game is a race against time, as players must complete each floor before the timer runs out.

**What to Expect**: 
Players will navigate through each level using the D-pad to move Thomas left or right, avoiding or defeating enemies with punches and kicks (B and A buttons, respectively). Jumping and crouching (up and down on the D-pad) are crucial for dodging attacks and overcoming obstacles. The game is straightforward but challenging, requiring quick reflexes and timing to progress. It's a classic beat 'em up experience that's easy to learn but hard to master, making it accessible for all players, even those not familiar with video games.

**TL;DR**:
Beat enemies, save girlfriend, classic arcade action.

**TL;DRier TL;dr**: 
Fight, jump, rescue in a martial arts challenge.
