Instead, it is an unlicensed NES puzzle game that incorporates themes and stories from the Bible, specifically focusing on the book of Exodus. Players control Moses as he attempts to free the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. The game's levels are designed to represent Moses' journey, filled with obstacles and enemies that he must overcome through faith and divine intervention.

The objective is to collect enough Manna to reveal the level's exit, symbolizing Moses' reliance on divine providence. Players use the "W.O.R.D." to eliminate enemies and obstacles, representing Moses' faith and the power of God's word. Bombs are used to destroy walls, making way for Moses to lead the Israelites through. The game incorporates Bible verses, providing spiritual lessons and context for each level's challenges.

**Jeffrey's Mom's Review**: "I thought this was just another video game, but it's actually quite educational. I didn't get very far, and all the Bible verses made me feel like I was back in Sunday school. But, honestly, it was nice seeing Jeffrey play something that wasn't just mindless shooting. Who knew video games could teach you something about faith?"
