**Game Plot**:
In "The Rocketeer," players step into the boots of Cliff Secord, a stunt pilot who stumbles upon a top-secret jetpack that thrusts him into a world of adventure and danger. The game loosely follows the plot of the 1991 film, set against the backdrop of 1930s Hollywood and the looming threat of World War II. Players must navigate through various levels, from daring aerial dogfights to intense ground-based combat, in an effort to thwart the evil plans of Neville Sinclair, a Nazi spy looking to steal the jetpack for his nefarious purposes.
