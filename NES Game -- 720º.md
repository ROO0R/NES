**Inspired Food Item**: *Skateboard Supreme Sundae* - A towering sundae built on a foundation of crunchy waffle cone pieces, symbolizing the gritty pavement of Skate City. Scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream represent the black-and-white simplicity of mastering the basics, drizzled with caramel and strawberry sauce for the blood and sweat of pushing through each trick. Topped with a miniature edible skateboard made of chocolate, it's a sweet tribute to the ups and downs of skateboarding life.
