As you progress, mastering the combination of movement and attacks is crucial for overcoming the hordes of enemies and challenging bosses. The game requires strategic thinking to decide when to engage or evade enemies, blending fast-paced action with tactical gameplay.

**Inspired Food Item**: *The Vigilante's Victory Burger* - A double-layered beef burger, each patty symbolizing the player and the brother, united with a spicy "revenge" sauce, topped with onion rings representing the "rings" of enemies defeated, all between a sesame seed bun. This hearty meal is meant to fuel the spirit of anyone on their own mission, no matter how challenging.
